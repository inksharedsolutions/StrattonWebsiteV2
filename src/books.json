It is a result of extensive research of the methods cancer victors have used to make themselves cancer free. Read their stories, which is a directory of over 3,000 people who beat their cancer using the treatments described in this book. The objectives of the book are these:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Encourage you to be open-minded and seek all the information about your choices of treatments\r\n* Be a starting point for your discussions with your doctor or with the qualified, licensed physicians who use these treatments in their practices, or your chosen natural therapist. Please do not delay in consulting a licensed physician for an opinion if you suspect you have cancer.\r\n* Be a starting point for your own research so you can make the best-informed decisions about your treatment plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consensus of the majority of alternative cancer therapists is that, the chance of full recovery using alternative therapies is almost 100% with a newly diagnosed condition of early cancer, before any traumatic or toxic treatments have been received. Unfortunately, by the time most patients consider alternative treatments, they have already undergone other treatments. The e-book does not advise you which treatments to choose. It simply provides you with information that you are unlikely to obtain from your doctor or find by yourself. You can make use of the information in discussions with experts who developed these treatments and with the qualified, licensed physicians, therapists, and clinics who use them in their practices."},{"id":946656000,"title":"Working With Weight\r","subtitle":"Overcoming Obesity\r","author":"Thomas Taylor M D\r","genre":"Health, Fitness & Dieting\r","amazon_link":"https://www.amazon.com/Working-Weight-Overcoming-Thomas-Taylor/dp/1648954006/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1642671598&sr=8-1\r","date":"undefined undefined, undefined","thumbnail":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61remnMv0-S.jpg\r","content":"This book addresses in a comprehensive and understandable manner for the lay public the causes of weight gain and its treatment.

He brings it all home with his down-to-earth style and considerable knowledge. In Unbreakable Hearts, Dusty dives into the Vietnamese history and culture and skillfully brings the reader into understanding our Vietnamese enemy's amazing resolve. He brilliantly explains the evolution of our Vietnamese enemy over hundreds of years of invasions and wars. Always defending their country to remain free became an art. In Chapter 7, Dusty describes the Vietnamese women fighters as \"Hellcats.\" My own experience with the formidable Vietnamese Viet Cong women's skills and expertise closely mirrors Dusty's. Hooch girls could plant booby traps in a GI's hooch with a skill and savvy they were forced to learn during decades of on-the-job training in continuous wars with unwelcomed invaders.\r\n\r\nMy own Military Police experience after leaving the infantry revealed these incidents vividly. In later chapters, Dusty moves into our own veterans' profound resolve and toughness. North Vietnam's famed General Giap called us \"an honorable enemy.\" One could suggest from this writing that our enemy taught us well. We did things in the Vietnam War the average person would have to go to the movies to believe. After reading Trimmer's descriptions, I must conclude that indeed this book could be one for the movie industry.\r\n\r\nDusty Trimmer brings to life our days and nights living and fighting in these foreboding jungle warfare conditions. After reading this fine work and reflecting on my own experiences, I cut away a little more of the pain. Pride swells for having served with all of these wonderful veterans of the Vietnam War. Pain for our terrible losses. For myself, these experiences culminated in wisdom I would otherwise have failed to achieve. God bless Dusty for telling our story.

Whether we make that stretch or not, responsibility for our own health is clearer than ever before. Your health is not something that can be maintained by anyone else.

She pursued a part-time career in photography, freelance writing and illustrating, and coauthoring the book Maine Paradise with Russell D. Butcher, published by Viking Press in 1972.

Her greatest love, of course, is for her seven children, fourteen grandchildren, and three great grandchildren. A major love throughout her many years is music. She loves to sing. Jean Marie has sung and played hand bells in many of the churches in her area of Maine. She directed a folk choir for ten years in Seal Harbor, consisting of her children and many others, both young and old from the community. She traveled throughout New England with Norumbega Harmony, singing shaped note, sacred harp hymns written for pre-Revolutionary war congregational singing. In 1986, she joined the Surry Opera Company in Down East Maine. She toured with the company to the USSR during the cold war, singing in Leningrad, Moscow, the Republic of Georgia, and Japan. Her two trips to sing in the Republic of Georgia haunted her with the feeling that she had lived there before. That déjà vu and her love for that country resulted in the creation of this book, The Vine and the Cross."},{"id":946656000,"title":"The Tool Made Easy!\r","subtitle":"","author":"Tonilynn Mercone\r","genre":"Self-Help\r","amazon_link":"https://www.amazon.com/Tool-Made-Easy-Tonilynn-Mercone/dp/1643459139/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1643367655&sr=8-1\r","date":"undefined undefined, undefined","thumbnail":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715R8RpjLPL.jpg\r","content":"The TOOL Made Easy! is a way of life, not a diet.

A general approach to the way this plays out at field level was provided; but now, there has been some actual experience that we use to flesh out the process.\r\n\r\nThrough a grant from a local economic development organization, Luke 16 Corp (a non-profit founded by Nathan) purchased a building and built out areas for incubated businesses. This facility also included a café for training people for work focused on customer service. It is an unusual concept in that businesses get support by the Luke 16 organization. This book is about how to garner the support necessary to make projects like this be all that they can be.\r\n\r\nJeffery Baker is joining in this book to provide the additional perspective that will make it much richer in terms of a broader knowledge of field work. Both Nathan and Jeff have entrepreneurial backgrounds and seek to foster a better understanding of the power that can come from true service-oriented approach.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, our experience has helped us understand the potholes that await anyone who seeks to step out in faith. Profit was directed toward churches, and to some degree businesspeople, who weren't that interested in either social enterprises or social entrepreneurship. So, here's the approach in Service: let's develop the notion that servants are not weak or ignorant folks who can't or won't take on such projects. As we look at what it means to be a servant leader, we hope you will find yourself imagining how you can pursue your dream or objective with this approach.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the main focus still has to be on developing community. For we believe that only by doing so can there be a meaningful impact on helping to alleviate poverty. We will look closely at the fallacy of other programs and provide some alternatives that can be very effective."},{"id":946656000,"title":"The DMV48 Men Of Power\r","subtitle":"A Local Guide To Great Black Men in the DMV\r","author":"\"Dr Reneé Allen \"\r","genre":"Self-Help\r","amazon_link":"https://www.amazon.com/DMV48-Men-Power-Local-Guide/dp/1648955126/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1642686249&sr=8-1\r","date":"undefined undefined, undefined","thumbnail":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DUTdC8ErL.jpg\r","content":"The time has come to celebrate black men.

Many have accomplished so much with so little fanfare, often hidden in the shadows of time and a society that fears them rather than elevate them. Now more than ever, black men need to stand up and be counted. Now more than ever, we must transform our thinking to know that these fathers aren't deadbeats, but determined to make it in the midst of what is often insurmountable odds. We shine a light on great men who have and are doing great things in the Washington Metropolitan Area. We bet you didn't know local black men had accomplished so much with so little fanfare.

He explores the Quantum World and how magnetism was created from the beginning before anything existed, and how its components changed everything and began the Creation Process and led to the Big Bang. Without the Big Bang we wouldn't have had anything, but with the Big Bang following Quantum Law including Einstein's theory the entire Physical Universe was created. The Super Massive Storms which formed in the Dark World that created the galaxies and converted into Super Massive Black Holes to control the Universe. Dark Matter came along to hold the Universe together, and its partner, Dark Energy, emerged to keep things far enough apart to maintain the Universe for billions upon billions of years. The significance of the Higgs Boson, and the evolutionary Processes of Energy, Matter, Life, and Particle Formation that provided the elements necessary to create Space, Time, Space-Time \"Fabric\", Light, Atoms, Matter, and Gravity all of which came together to form Stars, then Planets and all other Celestial Matter. And finally, Life evolved into the creation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLife changed everything throughout the entire Universe, and, of course, it was God's main purpose for the creation, and gave God and his Universe a reason for their existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTake a big step forward in understanding the world and decide for yourself the role God plays in our lives with the facts and insights in this book that explores the origins of the Universe. Then, sit back for some heavy thinking (meditation if you prefer). Then, sit back further and ask yourself (What is this World and Life all about?). Is God for Real?

I've been reading and writing my whole life, and providence has compelled me far too long to write a book, so here we are. The book may be crude and raw, but outside Calvary's forgiveness, it's neither worth writing or reading. I honestly feel like the \"least of all of these,\" not really gifted in any particular way, willing, though not particularly gifted. If I have a gift, it is in believing in the One that saved me, obedience to the One that called me. The Best Thing is meant to be driven, to stir you that you might exit the book transformed from your entrance. Don't leave the way you came. The book is designed to make you mad or get you excited, move you to sing your song, understand you are gifted, and share those gifts in a way that will make the world a better place. When I started the book, friends and family asked, \"What is the book about?\" God's amazing grace. It had to be His idea. Otherwise, it's just another book sitting on the shelf. It's in His hands. It is for His purpose and His glory. At the end of the day, when we do the math, consider the earth's spinning, rotating 23.5-degree axis, there is no other reasonable explanation for my testimony, my story, or yours save God's amazing grace. This book is for all people everywhere. It covers the globe, all races, religions, colors, and geographical locations. There are people everywhere living in the bondage of thousands of years of unforgiveness. God nailed His Son to a cross that we might be forgiven and forgive one another. This book is a call to put down our arms, receive God's payment on Calvary's shore, take up our crosses, and love one another. Jesus is not a thing. In fact, He is many things, so we'll just leave you with The Best Thing and pray that you drive it and hear the call within its pages to sing your song."},{"id":946656000,"title":"The Boundary Waters\r","subtitle":"A Quantum Adventure\r","author":"Gerry Huerth\r","genre":"Dramas & Plays\r","amazon_link":"https://www.amazon.com/Boundary-Waters-Quantum-Adventure/dp/1648953948/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3NBF336P7HC1V&keywords=9781648953941&qid=1642673467&sprefix=%2Caps%2C283&sr=8-1\r","date":"undefined undefined, undefined","thumbnail":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61CFV-YBtiS.jpg\r","content":"The Boundary Waters chronicles the unfolding and sometimes comic relationship between Raymona Washington Goldberg, an African American woman adopted as an infant by Jewish parents during a Freedom Ride in the 1960's and Matthew Pierson a gay man who geographically lives in Minneapolis but psychically inhabits a world of romantic fantasies.

I don't know about that, but those keys give you access into locked places that keeps everyone else out.\r\n\r\nThis book will reveal a mystery that, in my mind, will open the locked understanding of what Jesus was telling Peter in Matthew 16:19 when He said, \"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven\".\r\n\r\nThere are two important words in what Jesus told Peter. They are \"keys of\". Jesus was about to depart from earth through His crucifixion, death, and resurrection. He wanted to leave not only His disciples but all believers with tools or weapons to defeat the strategies of Satan. He delivered them to the disciples when He declared them to Peter. He said, \"I will give you the keys of the Kingdom\". That is much different than \"keys to the kingdom\". Jesus is the Key to the kingdom. But the keys of the kingdom are important to know.\r\n\r\nIn this book, you will find five very important keys to fight in the spirit realm. The rest of the paragraph is fine.

Jesus taught that the truth of God is simply too marvelous for human understanding so we must accept God in faith and in spirit. With that in mind it is a terrible conceit for any religious leaders to state that theirs is the only way to God. God will find a way to Him for all who lead a good life exhibiting the fruits of the spirit and search for Him in spirit.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the book is a call to all God's people of Islam to abandon all hatred, hostilities, greed and dissension as these do not come from a God whose nature is love, compassion and forgiveness. God wants to bring them peace and prosperity but that can only happen when all hatred and hostility is abandoned. If they do not heed this call from God then he will leave them to destroy themselves, which after all is what is happening now.\r\n\r\nFighting only breeds more fighting whereas love will conquer where guns will fail. This book is the spark to start the fire that God will cause to spread throughout the world.\r\n\r\nLook at the current destruction and desolation in the Middle East. Millions of Muslims are refugees in alien lands.\r\n\r\nThis is what the prophet Zechariah described:\r\n\r\nZechariah 7: 8-14\r\n\r\n\" And the word of the Lord came again to Zechariah: This is what the Lord Almighty says: ' Administer true justice; show mercy and compassion to one another. Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, the alien or the poor. In your hearts do not think evil of each other.'\r\n\r\nBut they refused to pay attention; stubbornly they turned their backs and stopped up their ears. They made their hearts as hard as flint and would not listen to the law or to the words that the Lord Almighty had sent by his Spirit through the earlier prophets. So the Lord Almighty was very angry.\r\n\r\nWhen I called , they did not listen; so when they called, I would not listen, says the Lord Almighty. I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations, where they were strangers. The land was left so desolate behind them that no one could come or go. This is how they made the pleasant land desolate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBrisbane \r\n\r\n<!--EndFragment-->"},{"id":946656000,"title":"I Die To Live\r","subtitle":"","author":"\" Perry D Defiore \"\r","genre":"Action & Adventure\r","amazon_link":"https://www.amazon.com/I-Die-Live-Perry-Defiore/dp/164895376X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1N6MZADV9MHJE&keywords=9781648953767&qid=1642672491&sprefix=9781648953767%2Caps%2C604&sr=8-1\r","date":"undefined undefined, undefined","thumbnail":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YcOsOvZ0S.jpg\r","content":"Once again, Ralph Mullen faces danger, but this time, he's on a mission for his grandson, who seems to have inherited his grandfather's nose for adventure, intrigue, and murder.\r\n\r\nThis is Perry's fifth Ralph Mullen book.

The book does not pretend to know or preach easy answers to life's struggles, nor offer comforting remarks on why evil exists. And in that alone lies the genius behind the fiction. Choosing to seek atonement for one's actions is a very personal journey fraught with self-doubt, fear, and mistrust. It is this experience which shapes who we are, and who we become.

This is all described in Revelation 8:5-12. The New World Order will take control of planet earth on May 4, 2027 and will be in control for the next 42 months. This is described in Revelation 13:1-5. No sooner than 21 months later Satan will appear on planet earth along with the angels that were thrown out of heaven with him. Four portions of Daniel and Revelation describe what will be happening during the remaining \"time of trouble\" while he is here. Most people are afraid of the unknown. In the end, God will create a \"new heaven and a new earth\" wherein will reign everlasting righteousness.

But God never promised us that life in this world would be a bed of roses. The word of God tells us that many are the afflictions of the righteous, but God reassures us that He will deliver us from them all. For the Love of God plays out those principles in the story of a father and son as they struggle to maintain their faithfulness and love for God in the midst of the tragedies, trials, and temptations that everyone who is called of God will encounter in life. This book encourages the reader to stay strong in faith and love for God, knowing that the love He has for you will never fail, and He will show Himself strong on your behalf if you only believe. For the Love of God is a spiritual and emotional roller-coaster ride that underscores one simple fact: Even in the face of adversity, everything we do, in words or in deeds, must be done for our love of God-and in His eternal love for us, we can find peace within ourselves and our lives in Christ."},{"id":946656000,"title":"Finding a Soulful Love\r","subtitle":"","author":"\"Lucinda Johnson \"\r","genre":"Romance\r","amazon_link":"https://www.amazon.com/Finding-Soulful-Love-Lucinda-Johnson/dp/1648954294/ref=sr_1_1?crid=32TPLMFYC0VSQ&keywords=9781648954290&qid=1642674743&sprefix=%2Caps%2C290&sr=8-1\r","date":"undefined undefined, undefined","thumbnail":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61fKndvBfuS.jpg\r","content":"This novel traces the journey taken by Cynthia as she began to search for love.

Unlike most other literary commentaries, this story has no predominant character dictating the flow of events. Most major players in the story play prevailing roles when portraying their respective charisma, for that moment giving impressions about their respective dominant roles in the context of the story.\r\n\r\nAzeem's decision to join the Pakistan army against the inclination of his loving Dada-ji (grandfather), his following shattered dreams, and the denial of his career progression in the Bangladesh army were successive debacles. In pursuing life, Shafiq, the much younger cousin of Azeem, played a unique role and discharged his responsibilities, as per the teachings of Dada-ji, in fulfilling the desires of the Madrasah-educated but very rural Dada-ji concerning the family. The story revolves around Dada-ji and his love and care for his grandsons, Azeem and Shafiq, and his granddaughter, Julaikha.\r\n\r\nThe uniqueness of the story is manifested in the love and support of the Pakistan army's Captain Riaz, the kindness and consideration shown by Babu Bijon Mohan Nag in trusting an unknown young Muslim man in the persona of Dada-ji, and the exceptional flexibility demonstrated by the dance teacher, Shibnath Bishwash, in accommodating Muslim Bijli and her grandma consequent to their home being gutted. Bijli portrayed the life and living of Jatra (a form of folk theater) party girls, was in love with Shafiq's father and youngest son of Dada-ji, Rakib, both to be victims of a boat capsize.\r\n\r\nThe story epitomizes the death of Azeem, the brutal murder of his son, Fazal, in a paramilitary-armed revolt, and the kidnapping of his growing grandson, Ameen. In all variable situations, life was never abandoned, and Rukiya, the wife of Azeem, nurtured and carried the torch of family dreams. She upheld that while saying Khuda-Hafeez to a loving grandson on his way to a higher education abroad. Life moves on with new hopes and dreams."},{"id":946656000,"title":"Bible Word Search From A-Z\r","subtitle":"","author":"\"Pauline T Hill \"\r","genre":"Puzzles & Games\r","amazon_link":"https://www.amazon.com/Bible-Word-Search-Pauline-Hill/dp/1648954200/ref=sr_1_1?crid=301YE6NVJ3U5O&keywords=9781648954207&qid=1642674059&sprefix=9781648954207%2Caps%2C290&sr=8-1\r","date":"undefined undefined, undefined","thumbnail":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61a2ujWOBFS.jpg\r","content":"Gain a concise fundamental grasp.

On reflection, he asked himself, What will I do with it? Without a use, the land would have no value. This insight showed him that the value of the land depended on the objective for which the land would be used, not some other person's opinion of its value. As a result, when he studied economics in college, he questioned the basic definition of an economic transaction. Rather than finding that that transaction was an exchange of currency for goods and services, he found that the basic transaction in economics was the use of a resource for accomplishing an objective. This enabled him to look at economies where money was not used.\r\n\r\nThe title of this book, Budget Your Goals Not Your Silver, is the result. Car salesmen are taught not to sell cars but what the cars will be useable for. The real estate agent must sell what the house can be used for and not the house itself. Cash economies must use data, and data is not available unless there is a unit of measurement, but the process of obtaining what is needed is not limited to cash economies. This book discusses the process of economies. As essential as economic studies are, valid economic studies must use data.

However, it was Eduardo's devotion to his brother and his determination in getting him back to his mother at any cost that determines their real fate."},{"id":946656000,"title":"Adoption Joys 2\r","subtitle":"\" Dads Make a Difference \"\r","author":"Doris Howe (\r","genre":"Family Relationships\r","amazon_link":"https://www.amazon.com/Adoption-Joys-Dads-Make-Difference/dp/164895488X/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1642686315&sr=8-1\r","date":"undefined undefined, undefined","thumbnail":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61xlZ5rs07L.jpg\r","content":"Doris Howe is a missionary with Youth with A Mission.

This is a work that would certainly be appreciated by many clergy and laity alike. The purpose of any exposition from the Word of God should always be (whether spoken or written) to guide, inspire, teach, encourage others to Christ and to live for Christ only. In this publication, James has much to contribute concerning Christian ethics. Again, and without doubt, we should be hearers of the Word. We receive the Word but not as \"believers only\" but as \"doers\" of the Word. Not just as believers of the faith but as doers of the faith in our daily walk with Christ. If we truly believe the Word of God, then we ought to live a life true and obedient to the Word of God, a life acceptable and holy unto God, which is our reasonable service, a living sacrifice. My brothers and sisters, read on, draw nigh to Christ, as he draws closer to you in a more personal and fulfilling way. Refer the Bible often and prayerfully as you read the contents of this publication. Expect something miraculous and wondrous to take place as you read. Live your life in expectancy of even a more blessed, abundant life. Ask God not only to bless you during and after reading this blessing but also to make you a blessing to others. Thank you for supporting this book ministry. To God be the glory! When asked, \"Why do you write?\" Dr. Wylie's refers to Habakkuk 2:2-4 and Ps. 97: 11-12."},{"id":946656000,"title":"A Tale of the Rat King\r","subtitle":"Be honest, be kind, be brave, and things will turn out okay.

One day, an evil, wicked, power hungry rat took over the kingdom. The horrible ruler only cared about himself and not the hard working struggling rat people. The Rat King did nothing to stop a deadly plague that fell upon their kingdom. He only wanted more money and more power at any cost. The hard working rats were becoming very ill and even dying. They were losing their jobs, couldn't pay their rent, and were going hungry, all because the Rat King lied to them. He kept saying the plague was fake and would magically go away. He was wrong but he would not admit it. Fortunately, help was close at hand. A very bright, brave and caring elder rat stepped forward to save the kingdom. The elder rat challenged the evil Rat King for the top spot, and won. The evil Rat King was banished to a far, far away land where he can not harm the rat people or the kingdom ever again."},{"id":946656000,"title":"A Walk of Many Paths\r","subtitle":"Poems Second Edition\r","author":"\"D M Ferguson \"\r","genre":"Literature & Fiction\r","amazon_link":"https://www.amazon.com/Walk-Many-Paths-Poems-Second/dp/1648955495/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1642687974&sr=8-1\r","date":"undefined undefined, undefined","thumbnail":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61GZv-xDeKL.jpg\r","content":"A Walk of Many Paths is the first book from former foster kid and survivor David Ferguson.

It’s a tongue-in-cheek, fun murder mystery. Think of it as Philip Marlowe meets Fritz the Cat. \r\n\r\nThe characters include Mathew “Duke” Hazzard, a feline who’d rather sleep or surf than do anything resembling work. We also meet his best friend, a big black lab that has an uncanny knack for showing up right when Duke’s about to get into trouble. There’s Gloria, a beautiful Siamese whose husband, Ralph, is found dead in his office at the local dog biscuit factory. Of course there’s Police Captain Ursalik, a big old grizzly who has been counting the days to retirement since he joined the force. And let’s not forget the de Katz brothers, who may or may not have been involved in the murder. \r\n\r\nSet in the twin towns of CatsCamp and Dogstown that straddle the Beaver Butt River just as it meets the ocean, this fun story takes us in and out of the surf zone and the local taverns before it culminates in a comedic chase scene down the rugged “Left Coast.” In the meantime, Duke gets into his share of scrapes—as any good tomcat does. He has to deal with a mother who thinks he’s lazy—even by cat standards. He also falls into a one-sided love affair with a beautiful gal from back east. \r\n\r\nYou could never call Duke a successful cat, and it seems that few in town like him very much. All in all, we are torn between laughing at and crying along with our very reluctant hero, but we cheer for him in the end as he solves his first case."},{"id":946656000,"title":"A Reluctant Pioneer\r","subtitle":"","author":"JoEllen Collins\r","genre":"Dramas & Plays\r","amazon_link":"https://www.amazon.com/Reluctant-Pioneer-Joellen-Collins/dp/164895328X/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1642670222&sr=8-1\r","date":"undefined undefined, undefined","thumbnail":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81j058X+ZDL.jpg\r","content":"Leah Brown, a wife and mother from San Francisco, decides to spend time at a small cabin built in Idaho territory in the late 1860's by her great, great grandparents, Linnea and Thaddeus Milton.

She honors the pioneer's words and imagines Linnea's unwritten thoughts. Leah experiences a surprisingly different time in the old cabin than she expected."}]

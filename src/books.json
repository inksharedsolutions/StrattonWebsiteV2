The stories, which are all drawn from true events, reflect the very personal, as well as equal, relationships which are a feature of country life. Like life itself, many of these stories are simultaneously both funny and sad. Yet More Tales of a Country Doctor, through the exploits of the various characters, explores many of the issues which face us all, and celebrates the indomitable spirit of every day heroes in overcoming whatever obstacles might lie in their way.\r\n\r\nAs with the two earlier books in the trilogy (\"Tales of a country doctor\", and \"The further tales of a country doctor\"), this collection of stories will keep you highly entertained, and stay in your mind for a long time to come."},{"id":946656000,"title":"World Without Cancer and Candida\r","subtitle":"","author":"Jack Mavian\r","genre":"Diseases & Physical Ailments\r","amazon_link":"https://www.amazon.com/World-Without-Cancer-Candida-Mavian/dp/1648953220/ref=sr_1_1?crid=24JUZF8IXDBQG&keywords=9781648953224&qid=1642667427&sprefix=9781648953224%2Caps%2C382&sr=8-1\r","date":"undefined undefined, undefined","thumbnail":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xssK9kqkL.jpg\r","content":"This book is a comprehensive compilation of over one hundred natural and alternative cancer treatments.

The latter include the protagonist, Mack Thomas, a recently retired - due to a back injury - rodeo bull rider, his struggling farmer father, and his uncle. These \"common folk,\" unpretentious, ethical, and socially and environmentally conscious, are the heroes of this story. They are pitted against the retrograde system of corruption run by a banker (a local fallen from grace), a sheriff, and other forces from the dark side, all of whom conspire to turn the local wildlife refuge into a resort, a playground for the wealthy. These forces will do anything to achieve their nefarious ends, including financial malfeasance on a massive scale, poisoning Mack's father's organically grown crops, and even murder. The dark forces individually represent other societal ills such as spousal abuse.\r\n\r\nThe wildlife refuge, the last vestige of central Minnesota's environment in its once pristine state, is at the center of this tale. It contains fast disappearing wetlands, an abundance of wildlife, and Walden-like nature in its purest and most transcendental form, Thoreau personified. The novel, published in 2010, is prescient. The criminal conspiracy that would destroy this Midwest Walden serves as a cautionary tale that speaks to the United States in late 2018, a nation struggling under the weight of environmental degradation, mendacity in the public and private spheres, and corruption in all its myriad forms.\r\n\r\n     The heroes of this story, Mack, his father and uncle, and two women friends, embody the values and traditions that are the polar opposite of the dark forces. They are generous, empathetic, deeply moral against the hypocrisy - in the view of the main characters - of right-wing fundamentalism, quiet and reserved as opposed to the bluster of those on the side of darkness. It is almost as if Trump himself were lurking in the background of this story.\r\n\r\n     WHY A REFUGE manages to communicate these ideas without preaching. As a thriller, the plot's the thing. Suspense and plot twists and turns are in more than sufficient supply to keep the reader turning the pages. For many fans of murder mysteries, the novel is a one-sit-down read.\r\n\r\n     Other attractions include the poetic and deeply moving descriptions of the refuge, the spare and salty speech of the heroes, psychological believability, and authenticity of setting. Not everyone will side with the novel's implicit - and on occasion explicit - take on political and social issues, but there is more than enough of the \"good stuff\" to keep the reader engaged. This novel deserves five stars."},{"id":946656000,"title":"What If She Knew She Was Powerful\r","subtitle":"A Real Life SuperWoman\r","author":"Shelia Lenora Johnson Peters\r","genre":"Biographies & Memoirs\r","amazon_link":"https://www.amazon.com/What-She-Knew-Was-Powerful/dp/164345921X/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1643373076&sr=8-1\r","date":"undefined undefined, undefined","thumbnail":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wZvG39HxL.jpg\r","content":"This biography brings to light the suffering and abuse of a woman who has endured much.

He brings it all home with his down-to-earth style and considerable knowledge. In Unbreakable Hearts, Dusty dives into the Vietnamese history and culture and skillfully brings the reader into understanding our Vietnamese enemy's amazing resolve. He brilliantly explains the evolution of our Vietnamese enemy over hundreds of years of invasions and wars. Always defending their country to remain free became an art. In Chapter 7, Dusty describes the Vietnamese women fighters as \"Hellcats.\" My own experience with the formidable Vietnamese Viet Cong women's skills and expertise closely mirrors Dusty's. Hooch girls could plant booby traps in a GI's hooch with a skill and savvy they were forced to learn during decades of on-the-job training in continuous wars with unwelcomed invaders.\r\n\r\nMy own Military Police experience after leaving the infantry revealed these incidents vividly. In later chapters, Dusty moves into our own veterans' profound resolve and toughness. North Vietnam's famed General Giap called us \"an honorable enemy.\" One could suggest from this writing that our enemy taught us well. We did things in the Vietnam War the average person would have to go to the movies to believe. After reading Trimmer's descriptions, I must conclude that indeed this book could be one for the movie industry.\r\n\r\nDusty Trimmer brings to life our days and nights living and fighting in these foreboding jungle warfare conditions.

Science cannot say that we are spiritual in nature, but it is not a great stretch to conclude that our essence is spiritual. Whether we make that stretch or not, responsibility for our own health is clearer than ever before. Your health is not something that can be maintained by anyone else.

The story unfolds in the lower reaches of the Appalachian Mountain chain on a plateau called Brindley Mountain. A part of the Sand Mountain Ridge, the area covers lower Morgan County and north east Cullman County. In an earlier time, the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Cherokee, and Creek hunted in relative peace across these ridges and valleys of north-central Alabama. In 1873, a young, rebellious Bavarian named Johann Gottfried Cullmann came into the area seeking a peaceful haven for his immigrating countrymen. He ultimately selected a large swath of this gently-sloping and pine-forested wilderness for his new Deutsche Kolonie. Other hardly pioneers began to homestead the free federal lands. This produced a rather odd mingling for the rural South. A fledgling town grew rapidly with its blacksmith shops, cotton gins, grist mills, ice house, and merchant class.\r\n\r\nOn a hardscrabble farm south of this bustling county seat, a young boy grew to manhood dreaming of future journeys and conquests. On the back porch of a little clapboard house, this would-be traveler contemplated the wide horizon stretching out in all directions, full of seemingly endless possibilities and challenges.\r\n\r\nDr. C. Eugene Scruggs retired following a long career as professor and administrator in higher education. Dr. Scruggs's career covered forty years at four US universities and two European.

He served two terms as chair of the Department of Foreign Languages at the University of South Florida in Tampa. Following his retirement, Scruggs published three books and coedited one other. His lifelong hobby has been art. He has created several hundred watercolor and pastel painting. More recently his passion has been vocal music, from Barbershop to Gospel, to Western.

In the interim between the journey and the destination, everyone is busy trying to navigate the journey while not necessarily giving enough serious thought to the journey's final destination. Yes! People are getting married or not, divorcing, pursuing educational and career goals, saving and spending, living life in the blind while paying little or no attention to the fact that time, as we know it, is running out of time. Most believers or Christians believe Christ will return one day and rescue His people out of this life. Although Christians do typically believe and may even pray for the return of Christ, some lack a clear understanding of what the Bible teaches about the Second Coming of Christ. On the other hand, there is a disproportionate number or group of people that, because they have been hearing all of their lives that Jesus is coming back, are ignoring the clear and concise prophetic writing on the prophetic wall that time is running out of time! Nonetheless, the Bible is inundated with prophecies that are unmistakably clear regarding the Second Coming of Christ. Therefore, this book, The Second Coming of Christ: The Rapture and the Revelation, is a book that unveils and reveals the fact that prophecy is history written in advance. The last word in its title, Revelation, points to the appearing of Christ at the culmination of the Great Tribulation for the battle of Armageddon, the battle of all battles. This book is the sounding of the alarm that each of us should be, through diligent preparation and godly steadfastness with uncompromising stick-to-itiveness, living to live again. Each of us during this dispensation of grace will be, upon Christ's return, left behind to undergo the unspeakable suffering of the Great Tribulation, or either resurrected or translated in glorified bodies to meet Christ in the air to go with Him to Heaven. This book will help each of us embrace the fact that the rapture of the Church is imminent or very close at hand.

The broken bond of a relationship can be compared to the loud \"pop\" of a light bulb that echoes throughout a room when it illuminates it for the final time.\r\n\r\nFor over 3,000 years people have been experiencing broken hearts. Many cultures compare the success of a relationship to the Infinity symbol. People believe that when a relationship has ended a break has occurred within the Infinity symbol of that relationship. Infinity represents regeneration which can help to keep a relationship harmonious, balanced and happy.\r\n\r\nThe Infinity symbol can be compared to the structure of the double helix of the DNA that makes up all the cells of the human body. A break in these cells can result in illness, disease and death. The broken bond of the Infinity symbol of a relationship can help to explain the extreme pain of the heart and soul. On the other hand, a harmonious, healthy relationship emits a positive energy between both partners which is depicted with the Infinity symbol.\r\n\r\nThe heart does not discriminate when falling in love with another individual. The Secret That Lies Beneath offers insight and remedies to help heal an individual's heart and soul. Far too often individuals put the blame onto themselves upon the ending of a relationship. When meeting an individual, who may be a long-term partner, we need to trust this individual slowly before allowing them full access to our heart and soul. Trust is earned. The book delves into the reasons that we fall in love with certain individuals and helps us identify healthy relationships in the future.\r\n\r\nI wish you all long and happy lives while on your path of self-discovery! May you be strong with the sudden twists and turns that life has to offer us. Embrace each lesson and person that we meet along our journey. It helps to bring us to be the person that we are today and to the partner of our future."},{"id":946656000,"title":"The Satanic Myth\r","subtitle":"The Devil May Not Have Made You Do It!\r","author":"Dr. Barry D.

While Satan is mentioned in scripture, the concept is never developed theologically. People have to run from Genesis to Isaiah trying to string a series of random verses together to get an understanding of who or what evil is composed of. When we get to historic Christianity, the doctrine of the devil is only second to the doctrine of God, and the devil is an indispensable part of the machinery of faith and piety. All of a sudden, we seem to have leaped from the Hebrew scriptures to the New Testament, and again, tying random scriptures together, we have developed a complete theology concerning evil and the ruler over it. The logic is inconsistent and doesn’t work with the evidence within the biblical text. Let’s look at the logic of the good and evil impulse within each individual that makes all of us free moral agents without the need for a Satan/Devil/Lucifer the way most Christians understand it.\r\n\r\nHaving preached for over forty years within the Lord’s body, Dr. Barry Fike has studied the Hebrew background of the New Testament church for over thirty years trying to understand the development of the body of Christ from its foundational Hebraic roots. While working with students at many educational levels, alongside the local body in California, Dr. Fike has a passion for learning the truth about theological positions that the church holds and testing it with his foundational knowledge. This book is a result of looking, studying, and probing into the biblical text and the evidence that comes from looking into its Hebrew background."},{"id":946656000,"title":"The Saint James Conspiracy\r","subtitle":"","author":"Jessica Murphy\r","genre":"Science Fiction & Fantasy\r","amazon_link":"https://www.amazon.com/Saint-James-Conspiracy-Jessica-Murphy/dp/1648950701/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1643550401&sr=8-1\r","date":"undefined undefined, undefined","thumbnail":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81utNEDmpTL.jpg\r","content":"Mackellan Kirby, professor of ancient religious studies, with some ongoing connection to the British SAS, is enjoying retirement in Ireland when he discovers an anomaly in the Dead Sea Scroll he has been entrusted with translating.

For this reason, some have questioned Solomon's authorship of the book. But Solomon is only one of many who have taken a spiritual detour in life. As a result, there are many people in our nation and our world who can readily identify with the outlook of Ecclesiastes, because they too are living their lives as Solomon did for a time-\"under the sun.\" This verse-by-verse tour of Solomon's experience will help you understand where Solomon's spiritual detour took him, and where he finally came to realize he should have been going instead.

Trapped by their own devices, they must now battle alongside the men they stranded in a desperate attempt to thwart the very army they once belonged to.

After that, he talks of his childhood villages on the way to Jijiga, the eastern city of Ethiopia, and then to the port city of Bosaso. But he passed a lot of difficulties on his journey.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to track how many days the writer spent. He spent seventy-one hours walking in the Sahara Desert without food and water before crossing the Gulf of Aden. In those circumstances, days and nights lacked meaning. One can hardly tell what day of the week is any given day. All that matters is getting there at all cost.\r\n\r\nHowever, the most dangerous trip was the perilous fourty-one-hour journey in the waters of the Arabian Gulf. People are crammed into a rickety boat made for a dozen people. Some of the stories told in this fateful journey are too gruesome to mention. Suffice to say, it is a life-and-death situation.

'Why' he asks, 'should anyone be interested in a GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JOB? For the same reason that the Book of Job is included in the Bible, ' he says. In the wisdom of the Church and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, the Book of Job becomes Sacred Scripture to keep the conversation about God honest. McClelland goes on to suggest that Jesus is God's Apology to the world for His questionable behavior in the Old Testament, and particularly His use of Job and his family as stakes in a wager to bolster His Ego's insecurity. In Jesus, God has taken responsibility for His part in creating the problem of our alienation by failing to live up to His godly responsibilities as a loving Father. Furthermore, McClelland goes on to argue that while the Church often gives God a 'pass, ' lest He incriminate Himself by His own Word, God has, nevertheless, entrusted this amazing offer of Reconciliation to our interpretation of His Son, Jesus. Christ's death, therefore, is seen as Atonement, not only for our sins, but for God's Sin as well.

The context changes, but how you manage the context and complexities will determine the effectiveness of your leadership. Working with global organizations, I see many obstacles to being a successful global leader, such as organizational development, strategic planning, and effective communication. Most leaders I work with can manage and follow a task or directive, but few can create processes such as strategic plans in which they identify local challenges and create global opportunities. Why do many leaders have difficulty developing into global leaders? The issue is based in complexity.\r\n\r\nWhat makes global leadership so complex? Is it the well-known difficulties of cross-cultural communication or the inability to develop a global mindset? Although the answer is yes to both questions, they are not the main reasons. The complexity of global leadership is the most obvious when leaders have to make strategic decisions for an organization filled with crisis, conflict, and a diverse background of followers.\r\n\r\nBy presenting the five principles of leadership in a global context, I look at the need, challenges, and opportunities for global leaders. The first task in understanding the impact of the five principles is to form a true definition of global leadership. The definition encompasses more than just selling products or managing teams across national boundaries.\r\n\r\nA global leader is a person who leads across cultures with systems, processes, and relationships in a complex environment."},{"id":946656000,"title":"The Finisher\r","subtitle":"","author":"Bert Marshall\r","genre":"Action & Adventure\r","amazon_link":"https://www.amazon.com/Finisher-Bert-Marshall/dp/1648953867/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1642673430&sr=8-1\r","date":"undefined undefined, undefined","thumbnail":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718W-JCo5gS.jpg\r","content":"Tommy Morris was medically discharged from the US Air Force after numerous tours in the Middle East as a decorated Pararescueman turned sniper.

Many have accomplished so much with so little fanfare, often hidden in the shadows of time and a society that fears them rather than elevate them. Now more than ever, black men need to stand up and be counted. Now more than ever, we must transform our thinking to know that these fathers aren't deadbeats, but determined to make it in the midst of what is often insurmountable odds.

He explores the Quantum World and how magnetism was created from the beginning before anything existed, and how its components changed everything and began the Creation Process and led to the Big Bang. Without the Big Bang we wouldn't have had anything, but with the Big Bang following Quantum Law including Einstein's theory the entire Physical Universe was created. The Super Massive Storms which formed in the Dark World that created the galaxies and converted into Super Massive Black Holes to control the Universe. Dark Matter came along to hold the Universe together, and its partner, Dark Energy, emerged to keep things far enough apart to maintain the Universe for billions upon billions of years. The significance of the Higgs Boson, and the evolutionary Processes of Energy, Matter, Life, and Particle Formation that provided the elements necessary to create Space, Time, Space-Time \"Fabric\", Light, Atoms, Matter, and Gravity all of which came together to form Stars, then Planets and all other Celestial Matter. And finally, Life evolved into the creation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLife changed everything throughout the entire Universe, and, of course, it was God's main purpose for the creation, and gave God and his Universe a reason for their existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTake a big step forward in understanding the world and decide for yourself the role God plays in our lives with the facts and insights in this book that explores the origins of the Universe. Then, sit back for some heavy thinking (meditation if you prefer). Then, sit back further and ask yourself (What is this World and Life all about?). Is God for Real?

I've been reading and writing my whole life, and providence has compelled me far too long to write a book, so here we are. The book may be crude and raw, but outside Calvary's forgiveness, it's neither worth writing or reading. I honestly feel like the \"least of all of these,\" not really gifted in any particular way, willing, though not particularly gifted. If I have a gift, it is in believing in the One that saved me, obedience to the One that called me. The Best Thing is meant to be driven, to stir you that you might exit the book transformed from your entrance. Don't leave the way you came. The book is designed to make you mad or get you excited, move you to sing your song, understand you are gifted, and share those gifts in a way that will make the world a better place. When I started the book, friends and family asked, \"What is the book about?\" God's amazing grace. It had to be His idea. Otherwise, it's just another book sitting on the shelf. It's in His hands. It is for His purpose and His glory. At the end of the day, when we do the math, consider the earth's spinning, rotating 23.5-degree axis, there is no other reasonable explanation for my testimony, my story, or yours save God's amazing grace. This book is for all people everywhere. It covers the globe, all races, religions, colors, and geographical locations. There are people everywhere living in the bondage of thousands of years of unforgiveness. God nailed His Son to a cross that we might be forgiven and forgive one another. This book is a call to put down our arms, receive God's payment on Calvary's shore, take up our crosses, and love one another. Jesus is not a thing.

The characters that inhabit their imaginary worlds range from rough-hewn cowboys to women of the theater and run the gamut of social class. The stories place these characters in a vast array of settings, from the rural Midwest to far-off Rio de Janeiro. Narrative voice may whisper intimate first person in the reader's ear or travel from the distance of third-person omniscience. Romance and love-besotted sex stand in contrast to the horror of pedophilia. The stories mark the passage of time, from childhood to old age. There are tales told from the few pages of sudden fiction to nearly the length of novelettes. Reality is reflected in stories of social realism and others of dream state. The mood may be lyrical or unsentimental.\r\n\r\nCommon threads hold these tales together. The search for social justice is prevalent. Deeply flawed characters display wellsprings of ethics and morality. Humor bends toward irony and parody. All these tales reflect delight in storytelling, as if the three brothers had spent their childhood sitting around a campfire listening to yarns that would mark them forever.

Henry counters by sending an army to Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe novel begins with Thomas's trek, precipitated by the fall of his family's castle, to an ally's stronghold in the west of Ireland. Once there, he and his wife, Frances, struggle to rekindle the revolt's waning popularity. Their efforts fail, and Frances goes to England, where she appeals to her cousin Ann Boleyn to intercede on Thomas's behalf with her husband, Henry VIII. Thomas, after surrendering on terms later treacherously rescinded by Henry, returns to England, where he is imprisoned in the Tower. The novel concludes by describing the events that occur when the desperate efforts of Frances, and a priest friend, fail to obtain amnesty for Thomas.\r\n\r\nGardiner Noble is a retired electrical engineer who spent forty years in the automobile industry. He is the inventor of the coil-on-plug ignition system, which is used in most cars manufactured around the world.

These teachers from the stars shared their wisdom with the ancient humans--secrets that have helped the human race thrive against all the odds.\\\r\nPresent day Earth is in trouble. Stripped of her resilience by generations of reckless abuse of her natural resources, all signs point to an impending disaster beyond imagination that threatens all life on Earth. The fate of the planet may hang on the efforts of a few select humans.\\\r\nAbigail, a New Zealand grandmother and writer, has been asked to make a record of what could be humanity's last days. In Australia, a forest regeneration expert named Danny may be the key to rebuilding Earth's ecosystem.\\\r\nHordea, a benevolent extra-terrestrial with the knowledge to save the planet, appears. He invites Abigail and a select group of humans to join him on the mother ship for an educational adventure to other worlds. But on the return journey, the mother ship hurtles out of control due to nuclear fallout. Admontwalia, the leader of the visitors, explains that they need the humans to harness their mental abilities to help them guide their ship back to Earth.\\\r\nWhen they return, their worst fears are realized. The planet has shifted off its axis, the coastlines of the Earth are submerged, and new land has arisen from the oceans. Once again, humanity looks to the kachinas to save their world.\r\n\r\nI grew up in a market gardening area on the outskirts of Melbourne. The farmers used their trucks to create tracks through the native bush to reach their properties. In the spring, I spent hours wandering through many acres of wildflowers. Not knowing the botanical names of endless varieties of blooms, I would name them. Even as a child, this delightful scene took my breath away. Although that place still holds the same name, neat rows of houses along straight tar-sealed roads cover the area.\\\r\nYears later, as the movie Star Wars ended, I remained glued to my seat. Mentally transported to other worlds, my mind opened to the realization that life existed outside our planet. It made sense that the immense size of our galaxy would most likely have other planets capable of supporting sentient beings. There are billions of galaxies in the universe that would have life-supporting solar systems. How insular I had been.\\\r\nI feel helpless to convince the world that our planet will likely reach a point that my granddaughters' generation will find uninhabitable. In an attempt to bring my opinion to worldwide notice, I wrote Return of the Kachinas.\\\r\nThe Freedom Riders became book 2 of the Kachina series.

We see Jesus graciously accept the challenge to humble Himself by becoming human and doing the only thing that will enable man to again have a personal relationship with the Father God, through His sacrifice on the cross.\r\n\r\nAs the reader explores the simple message of Jesus, they will come to realize who He was, what the kingdom of heaven is, where it is, and why it is so important that Jesus completed His mission on earth."},{"id":946656000,"title":"Mystery of the Keys of the Kingdom\r","subtitle":"Jesus's Gifts for a Life of Victory\r","author":"Deborah Bouchard\r","genre":"Religion & Spirituality\r","amazon_link":"https://www.amazon.com/Mystery-Keys-Kingdom-Jesuss-Victory/dp/1648954766/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1642679735&sr=8-1\r","date":"undefined undefined, undefined","thumbnail":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Wa2DWw0IS.jpg\r","content":"Keys are an important part of our lives. I once heard someone say that the more keys you hold, the more power you have. I don't know about that, but those keys give you access into locked places that keeps everyone else out.\r\n\r\nThis book will reveal a mystery that, in my mind, will open the locked understanding of what Jesus was telling Peter in Matthew 16:19 when He said, \"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven\".\r\n\r\nThere are two important words in what Jesus told Peter. They are \"keys of\". Jesus was about to depart from earth through His crucifixion, death, and resurrection. He wanted to leave not only His disciples but all believers with tools or weapons to defeat the strategies of Satan. He delivered them to the disciples when He declared them to Peter. He said, \"I will give you the keys of the Kingdom\". That is much different than \"keys to the kingdom\". Jesus is the Key to the kingdom. But the keys of the kingdom are important to know.\r\n\r\nIn this book, you will find five very important keys to fight in the spirit realm. The rest of the paragraph is fine. You may have known about them but putting these simple but extremely important tools in your toolbox will help you to live the life Jesus said in John 10:10.

What lessons are in store for Justin?\r\n\r\nEverything he knows will be put to the test, even his own faith and sanity.\r\n\r\nHow do you handle bullying, betrayal of a family member or a \"friend,\" abuse, and suicide by a friend or loved one? What do you do when you don't have a support network? How do you make relationships that last? Will it take a miracle or do those even exist?\r\n\r\nJustin has to learn to trust his gut, wits, and to learn to believe in himself in order to survive. In the end the person you have to trust the most is yourself. We are faced with many challenges and decisions in our lives. Some for the better and some for the worst.\r\n\r\nYour support network is important, and if you don't think you have one, get one. Not all friends are friends. Even a family member may have it in for you. If you are unsure whom to trust, trust a professional. There are services out there that may be even free to help you along.\r\n\r\nJustin reaches out several times throughout his journey and so should you. Not all problems can be solved alone or totally solved at all.\r\n\r\nLife's pressures and tribulations can affect you in many ways including those around you. Ever sit with negative people at a table? Try it as an experiment. It won't take long for you to join them in the negativity. Now sit with positive people and see what happens. How does it make you feel after each one?\r\n\r\nThere is a saying that when times are good, you are surrounded by many who care. See who are there when times are not good.\r\n\r\nJustin's journey will take you there through thick and thin as he develops from a thirteen-year-old boy to the man he is today. His relationships are molded through learning as are yours. Life never stops teaching us so never stop learning."},{"id":946656000,"title":"Jonathan's New Day\r","subtitle":"","author":"Kendell Easley\r","genre":"Literature & Fiction\r","amazon_link":"https://www.amazon.com/Jonathans-New-Day-Kendell-Easley/dp/1643458531/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1643365523&sr=8-1\r","date":"undefined undefined, undefined","thumbnail":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lbzAk5KsL.jpg\r","content":"The scene is Isreal in the time of Christ; the hero, a young boy whose life intersects with the Jewish carpenter.

We attempt to define and describe these real-life circumstances, and we discuss ways to proactively deal with them. Multiple personal and professional perspectives provide valuable insights.\r\n\r\nWhat is dying like for the dying person, for loved ones, and for those who lend support? Each experience will have unique qualities. While we explore the dying process, we make no assumptions about how any particular death will unfold.\r\n\r\nIn Journey's End, Part 2: An Educational Guide to Death and Dying, our primary focus is education for students, laypersons, or professionals. Resources, tools, professional training information, and grief and bereavement support, material about assisted dying and euthanasia policies from around the world are covered in this book. Also included are professional perspectives to assist the reader in preparing themselves or to support others in their dying times.\r\n\r\nMy educational background and training provide me with a good foundation for my professional path. I have a master of social work degree with a bachelor's in sociology. I have worked as a case manager for twenty-one years and a therapist for one and a half years. I also volunteered for six months before I found employment in Canada in the social services field. Helping others is my calling and has been for as long as I can remember.\r\n\r\nAs a professional who spent the past twenty years working with older adults, death, dying, and end-of-life issues come up.

Manglitz was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, November 24, 1938. When he was a small boy, his parents moved to Bridgeman, then to Holland, Michigan. Despite the conservative nature of that community and his family church, his childhood was a time of great imagination and wanderings on his bike and adventures in Dunn's woods. In his youth, his life became more complex as he became aware of his homosexuality. He didn't publically come out until he was twenty-eight.\r\n\r\nIn 1961, he graduated from Godben College. Later, he earned an MA from the University of Michigan and a PhD from Michigan State University. In 1961, he began teaching at Talas American School, near Kayseri and later at Tarsus College in Southern Turkey. Between 1961 and 1965, he traveled in the Middle East and in Southern Europe, spending his summers in Ibiza, Spain. Later, after returning to America, he visited Turkey, Spain, England, and the Czech Republic many times.\r\n\r\nAfter returning to America in 1965, he taught at South High School; in 1968, he taught at the community college until his retirement in 2002. During much of the time after his return, he was active in the Episcopal church. Presently, he lived in Michigan with his three cats: James, Cecilia, and Zachariah.\r\n\r\nHe has published poetry in Matrix and The James White Review."},{"id":946656000,"title":"Interrupted To Be\r","subtitle":"A Shepherd Boy's Journey to Kingship\r","author":"Dr. Annie B.

Jesus taught that the truth of God is simply too marvelous for human understanding so we must accept God in faith and in spirit. With that in mind it is a terrible conceit for any religious leaders to state that theirs is the only way to God. God will find a way to Him for all who lead a good life exhibiting the fruits of the spirit and search for Him in spirit.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the book is a call to all God's people of Islam to abandon all hatred, hostilities, greed and dissension as these do not come from a God whose nature is love, compassion and forgiveness. God wants to bring them peace and prosperity but that can only happen when all hatred and hostility is abandoned. If they do not heed this call from God then he will leave them to destroy themselves, which after all is what is happening now.\r\n\r\nFighting only breeds more fighting whereas love will conquer where guns will fail. This book is the spark to start the fire that God will cause to spread throughout the world.\r\n\r\nLook at the current destruction and desolation in the Middle East. Millions of Muslims are refugees in alien lands.\r\n\r\nThis is what the prophet Zechariah described:\r\n\r\nZechariah 7: 8-14\r\n\r\n\" And the word of the Lord came again to Zechariah: This is what the Lord Almighty says: ' Administer true justice; show mercy and compassion to one another. Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, the alien or the poor. In your hearts do not think evil of each other.'\r\n\r\nBut they refused to pay attention; stubbornly they turned their backs and stopped up their ears. They made their hearts as hard as flint and would not listen to the law or to the words that the Lord Almighty had sent by his Spirit through the earlier prophets. So the Lord Almighty was very angry.\r\n\r\nWhen I called , they did not listen; so when they called, I would not listen, says the Lord Almighty. I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations, where they were strangers. The land was left so desolate behind them that no one could come or go. This is how they made the pleasant land desolate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBrisbane \r\n\r\n<!--EndFragment-->"},{"id":946656000,"title":"I, Jetebais\r","subtitle":"","author":"Robert Martin Bishop\r","genre":"Literature & Fiction\r","amazon_link":"https://www.amazon.com/I-Jetebais-Robert-Martin-Bishop/dp/1648954626/ref=sr_1_1?crid=25DYYERZNLDR3&keywords=9781648954627&qid=1642674866&sprefix=9781648954627%2Caps%2C291&sr=8-1\r","date":"undefined undefined, undefined","thumbnail":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715MSImyVdS.jpg\r","content":"\"A high-fantasy account of reality as seen by one of Satan's brothers, sure to appeal to lovers of both fantasy and Christian literature.\"\r\n\r\n\\-Kirkus Reviews\r\n\r\n\"I, Jetebais becomes an almost revolutionary text. The book does not pretend to know or preach easy answers to life's struggles, nor offer comforting remarks on why evil exists. And in that alone lies the genius behind the fiction. Choosing to seek atonement for one's actions is a very personal journey fraught with self-doubt, fear, and mistrust. It is this experience which shapes who we are, and who we become. And as I, Jetebais shows, the cleansing and redemptive power of such a quest can rival that of any evil on earth, no matter how sinister.

This is all described in Revelation 8:5-12. The New World Order will take control of planet earth on May 4, 2027 and will be in control for the next 42 months. This is described in Revelation 13:1-5. No sooner than 21 months later Satan will appear on planet earth along with the angels that were thrown out of heaven with him. Four portions of Daniel and Revelation describe what will be happening during the remaining \"time of trouble\" while he is here. Most people are afraid of the unknown. In the end, God will create a \"new heaven and a new earth\" wherein will reign everlasting righteousness. When one considers all the problems facing planet earth, one might ask, is there any solution to this mess? The solution to all that we are facing is shown in this book."},{"id":946656000,"title":"Gilkey's Book of Poems\r","subtitle":"","author":"Keith A.

For example, if you were to ask someone what fruit Adam and Eve were tempted by, most people might say, \"An apple.\" If you were to ask what color the apple was, most people might state that they think the fruit was red.\r\n\r\nAre these actual facts? No. People are simply using artistic imagination. The stories in Genesis are multifaceted oral traditions about the human family that originated long before the established interpretations, dogmas, and doctrines of our contemporary world.\r\n\r\nOne thing the stories do indicate is that we are all genetically connected regardless of our outward appearance, yet we are divided due to multiple factors related to our situation in life and personal beliefs. The Genesis Quest examines ancient roots of human thinking to strip away veneers of progressive interpretations and reveal the evolution of a philosophy-six principles of the human spirit looking for the soul of our communal life: God/creation, good and evil, sharing, mercy, saving life, and communicating. These principles are intended to help us understand what it means to be human."},{"id":946656000,"title":"From an Out House to the White House\r","subtitle":"And Then Some\r","author":"Hal Davis\r","genre":"Biographies & Memoirs\r","amazon_link":"https://www.amazon.com/Out-House-White-Then-Some/dp/1648950159/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1643379551&sr=8-1\r","date":"undefined undefined, undefined","thumbnail":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ccjLKp8WL.jpg\r","content":"With over five decades of service to his country, Hal is certainly not a man to be easily detoured or dissuaded from his mission.

He had a bitter childhood that continued well into his teens, but everything changed after he became a member of the United States Marine Corps. His success was not given to him on a silver platter, it was definitely a roller-coaster adventure.  He lived, he laughed, he cried, he loved, he fell, and he rose yet again. From an Outhouse to the White House, and Then Some, will show you just how he did it.\r\n\r\nHal Davis is a distinguished US Marine (Ret.) with a career that spanned twenty-two years. In his heart, service is for a lifetime. He grew up in Morehead, Kentucky, and life back then was never easy. Deprived of all the good things that a childhood normally brings, he remained steadfast in reaching his goals. He became a Tennessee State Trooper, FBI Special Investigator, United States Secret Service Agent to two US presidents, and a Marine and Naval Criminal Investigator.

But God never promised us that life in this world would be a bed of roses. The word of God tells us that many are the afflictions of the righteous, but God reassures us that He will deliver us from them all. For the Love of God plays out those principles in the story of a father and son as they struggle to maintain their faithfulness and love for God in the midst of the tragedies, trials, and temptations that everyone who is called of God will encounter in life. This book encourages the reader to stay strong in faith and love for God, knowing that the love He has for you will never fail, and He will show Himself strong on your behalf if you only believe. For the Love of God is a spiritual and emotional roller-coaster ride that underscores one simple fact: Even in the face of adversity, everything we do, in words or in deeds, must be done for our love of God-and in His eternal love for us, we can find peace within ourselves and our lives in Christ."},{"id":946656000,"title":"For All Eternity\r","subtitle":"A Story of Heaven\r","author":"J.

Those many visits convinced him that he would become a farmer someday. His mom's cousin, Armand \"Wimpy\" Mertz, became his mentor.\r\n\r\nDon worked full-time for him after graduating from high school. He loved the cows, calves, pigs, chickens, wildlife, and especially the horses. Wimpy knew the names of the trees, weeds, other plants, bugs, and all of God's creation. Don admired his vast knowledge and was thankful for having such a wonderful teacher. He soon realized that his chances of purchasing a farm of their own was pretty slim. He worked on several agricultural-related jobs.\r\n\r\nHis friends Paul and Elvira Brunnquell convinced him to go on a blind date. Ruth Nienow, was his date; he fell madly in love with her and prayed that God would convince her to be his beautiful bride. One year later they were married. Her dad was a farmer, and they decided to purchase a farm. They saw an ad in the paper, \"Farm for Rent,\" and another ad, \"Purebred Herd of Holstein Cows for Sale.\" They purchased the cows and rented the farm. It was a nightmare. There was too much work and not enough income. Their landlord died six months later. The next farm was also bad news.

And I am one-hundred percent for certain, it's the select place to live in this universe.\r\n\r\nWithin this all about heaven book, cruisin' above the clouds means, I've found an intangible euphoric frame of mind. And my wonderful feelings for the land of Utopia are expressed through the many unusual and sincere bible stories I write.\r\n\r\nI am certain, most people believe the land of Utopia is an imaginary place, not real and tangible, and it would be impossible to find. However, finding the land of Utopia, and the euphoric spirit of Utopia isn't impossible to find. And one cannot be found, unless we find the other.\r\n\r\nI do want you to know, even though it's not a secret location. The map leading us to the land of Utopia doesn't have an \"x\" marking the location. However, it's for certain, we do have to grow wings and cruise above the clouds to find it.\r\n\r\nFinding the land of Utopia requires a Spirit Guide, and when we become euphoric about the world of God. Our caring Spirit Guide reveals a place above the clouds, and it's where the euphoric treasure hunters find their perfect home.\r\n\r\nThis serious and meaningful book has fifty-five unique bible stories. And reading them is like taking a cruise above the clouds, and entering into the realms of Utopia. And finding the land of Utopia will be like finding the Garden of Eden, and I do hope you find the kingdom of God too.\r\n\r\nGod bless you."},{"id":946656000,"title":"Creating Success with a Criminal Record\r","subtitle":"","author":"Archie R.

Unlike most other literary commentaries, this story has no predominant character dictating the flow of events. Most major players in the story play prevailing roles when portraying their respective charisma, for that moment giving impressions about their respective dominant roles in the context of the story.\r\n\r\nAzeem's decision to join the Pakistan army against the inclination of his loving Dada-ji (grandfather), his following shattered dreams, and the denial of his career progression in the Bangladesh army were successive debacles. In pursuing life, Shafiq, the much younger cousin of Azeem, played a unique role and discharged his responsibilities, as per the teachings of Dada-ji, in fulfilling the desires of the Madrasah-educated but very rural Dada-ji concerning the family. The story revolves around Dada-ji and his love and care for his grandsons, Azeem and Shafiq, and his granddaughter, Julaikha.\r\n\r\nThe uniqueness of the story is manifested in the love and support of the Pakistan army's Captain Riaz, the kindness and consideration shown by Babu Bijon Mohan Nag in trusting an unknown young Muslim man in the persona of Dada-ji, and the exceptional flexibility demonstrated by the dance teacher, Shibnath Bishwash, in accommodating Muslim Bijli and her grandma consequent to their home being gutted. Bijli portrayed the life and living of Jatra (a form of folk theater) party girls, was in love with Shafiq's father and youngest son of Dada-ji, Rakib, both to be victims of a boat capsize.\r\n\r\nThe story epitomizes the death of Azeem, the brutal murder of his son, Fazal, in a paramilitary-armed revolt, and the kidnapping of his growing grandson, Ameen. In all variable situations, life was never abandoned, and Rukiya, the wife of Azeem, nurtured and carried the torch of family dreams. She upheld that while saying Khuda-Hafeez to a loving grandson on his way to a higher education abroad.

Overhead were three seagulls, making coaxing noises as they watched intently waiting for the morsel of bread she usually held out to them in her small, gentle hand. She loved the gulls. At times it seemed they were her only friends. She was a lonely child. Other children thought her strange. Cassie was like her namesake Cassandra, the beautiful oracle in Greek mythology, who also saw things that others could or would not see.

On reflection, he asked himself, What will I do with it? Without a use, the land would have no value. This insight showed him that the value of the land depended on the objective for which the land would be used, not some other person's opinion of its value. As a result, when he studied economics in college, he questioned the basic definition of an economic transaction. Rather than finding that that transaction was an exchange of currency for goods and services, he found that the basic transaction in economics was the use of a resource for accomplishing an objective. This enabled him to look at economies where money was not used.\r\n\r\nThe title of this book, Budget Your Goals Not Your Silver, is the result. Car salesmen are taught not to sell cars but what the cars will be useable for. The real estate agent must sell what the house can be used for and not the house itself.

The didactic lecture creates a passive learning environment in which students memorize facts and then regurgitate them on exams. We refer to this as bulimic learning. Knowledge retention is short-lived when the learning process is passive.\r\n\r\nResearch has shown that TBL enhances problem solving, improves student performance, sharpens critical thinking skills, prolongs knowledge retention, and ensures a high degree of learning satisfaction. TBL should replace the lecture in every academic program.\r\n\r\nThis book will provide faculty with a concise set of instructions on how to create a TBL course.

Duke discovers, with the help from a friendly band of river otters, that a rogue gang of seals are stealing all the salmon and trout from the Beaver Butt River and selling them on the black market to a cartel of ruthless muskrats for use in their slave-labor lutefisk factories. Duke, a feline, who, like most cats, would rather curl into a ball in that sunny spot on the couch and take a nap, ends up being harassed--as well as helped--by the local government to expose a case of corruption that may have led to murder! The action takes place on the water and on the shores of the wild and scenic Beaver Butt River, which flows between the two towns of CatsCamp and Dogstown before emptying into the ocean. We learn about the fish and the fishing that are a major factor in the lives of both towns both commercially and recreationally.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, we meet cast of wild creatures: Leo Phieu, an old one-eyed, fish-smelling Burmese who has inhaled his share of gasoline, paint, and fiberglass fumes over the years.

Think of it as Philip Marlowe meets Fritz the Cat. \r\n\r\nThe characters include Mathew “Duke” Hazzard, a feline who’d rather sleep or surf than do anything resembling work. We also meet his best friend, a big black lab that has an uncanny knack for showing up right when Duke’s about to get into trouble. There’s Gloria, a beautiful Siamese whose husband, Ralph, is found dead in his office at the local dog biscuit factory. Of course there’s Police Captain Ursalik, a big old grizzly who has been counting the days to retirement since he joined the force.

He has to deal with a mother who thinks he’s lazy—even by cat standards. He also falls into a one-sided love affair with a beautiful gal from back east. \r\n\r\nYou could never call Duke a successful cat, and it seems that few in town like him very much.

The purpose of any exposition from the Word of God should always be (whether spoken or written) to guide, inspire, teach, encourage others to Christ and to live for Christ only.

We receive the Word but not as \"believers only\" but as \"doers\" of the Word. Not just as believers of the faith but as doers of the faith in our daily walk with Christ.

My brothers and sisters, read on, draw nigh to Christ, as he draws closer to you in a more personal and fulfilling way. Refer the Bible often and prayerfully as you read the contents of this publication. Expect something miraculous and wondrous to take place as you read.

There finally comes a time when 'desperation' becomes the houses' last seat at the table. In the most improbable game of 21, Cisco \"The Dealer\" Wheeler dares to make a gamble with no logic against the odds for one last chance to experience the thing he loved the most!\r\n\r\nSteve Hayes and his love of baseball come honestly. As a formert player and student of the game, he authored the biography of Cincinnati Reds \"super-scout\" Gene Bennett and chronicled his 58 years with the team which became a \"Red's Nation\" best-seller.\r\n\r\nFor over fifty - years, Steve has enjoyed success in the radio business and has always considered himself just a story-teller at heart.\r\n\r\nBorn and raised in Southern Ohio, his radio travels have been through major markets such as Houston, Cincinnati, Louisville, Lexington, Ky. Daytona Beach, Jacksonville and Huntington, W.Va.\r\n\r\nReturning to his hometown in 1999 to assume radio ownership, on-air hosting, and management of several local stations, it brought his career full- circle to begin a dormant passion he had always known was within; writing.\r\n\r\nHe began as a weekly columnist for the local paper for almost fifteen years during which time writing successful insights and books fueled his creativity and passion. Steve's last memoir in 2017 was titled \"Snap Shots\" which was a regional bestt-seller about pop personalities with all profit- proceeds being donated to the local no-kill mal shelter.\r\n\r\nAt home on a five acre farm on the Ohio River, fishing, traveling, and collecting as many stories as he can is still Steve's regular routine. Added to the list, he is still collecting yarns to tell and getting up at 4:00 am to host his popular morning radio program from 5am-10am on WNXT-FM and worldwide at\r\n\r\nwnxtradio@yahoo.com."},{"id":946656000,"title":"15 Scientific Papers and Philosophical Essays\r","subtitle":"That Could Compel Scholars to Rethink the World\r","author":"Daniel Zanou\r","genre":"Self-Help\r","amazon_link":"https://www.amazon.com/Scientific-Papers-Philosophical-Scholars-Rethink/dp/1648951554/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1643544858&sr=8-1\r","date":"undefined undefined, undefined","thumbnail":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61-DGPYl4zL.jpg\r","content":"This book is challenging our orthodox view concerning the world. Failure to understand existence, humans live by instinct, and life has become tragedy and misery. Humans are more than animals, and the book is shedding light upon human beings, their behaviors, and the society they have created.\r\n\r\nOur world is divided between religion and science. Religious people know the inward man. Scientists apprehend the physical body but have no clue concerning what is moving the body. This compilation of articles is discussing how the inner system interacts with the physical body to create our realities. And the new tool that studies such interaction is called quantum biology\r\n\r\nWhile he was still a cadet at Ecole Navale in France, Daniel Zanou inherited the philosophical works of the French mathematician and philosopher Rene Descartes. Ten years later, he emigrated to the United States of America where he studied Emergency Medicine at Butler Tech in Ohio. He has become an independent researcher in quantum biology and continues his writings in philosophy. In 2018, he got his citizenship and worked since then as a truck driver over the road while carrying his research part-time."}]

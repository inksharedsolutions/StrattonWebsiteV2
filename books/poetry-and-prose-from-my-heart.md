Elizabeth Redhead Phillips's life changed in 2010 when God began showing her signs and visions and sharing powerful words for the people of Haiti after an earthquake devastated their country. In her first collection of poetry and prose, Phillip shares inspirational writings that reflect her profound exploration of spirituality, natural disasters, the creative process, and the importance of taking a risk, loving others, and speaking from the heart.

Phillip makes no secret of the fact that she lets God pilot her life. In her diverse reflections, she encourages others to put God first, learn from mistakes, work toward goals, help others, and be open to change as His hand gently guides us through life. In poems and prose that cover a wide range of relatable topics, Phillip not only reveals her challenges, but also her joys as she embraces the value of life, a family bond, and unconditional love.

Poetry and Prose from My Heart reveals one woman's unique journey through life as God lifts her up and gives her strength to survive, make a difference, and find happiness in every day.

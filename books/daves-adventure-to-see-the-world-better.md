Young Dave has been struggling in the classroom. His teacher notices he has been squinting and not able to see the chalkboard easily. The teacher sends a note back home with Dave for his parents, describing what he has noticed regarding Dave's inability to see clearly at a distance.

When Dave's parents read the note, they realized the book Dave's father just published was surprisingly well timed.

This book you are about to read is for the whole family, not just for kids. You will enjoy reading about Dave and his remarkable adventure to make his life clearer and more beautiful.

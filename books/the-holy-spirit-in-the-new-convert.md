The Holy Spirit in the New Convert is about a person accepting Jesus Christ as their personal Savior (Romans 10:9). Most individuals do not realize that when they accept Jesus as their personal Savior that the Holy Spirit comes to indwell/live/reside in them permanently until the day of redemption. The Holy Spirit resides in the believer to transform them in their salvation. It assists an individual in changing their thought pattern, behavior, and their belief in God/Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit is a transformer (Romans 12:2). It changes the individual's inner conscience from an unconverted conscience to a converted conscience-believing in Jesus. It then teaches us how to change our way of thinking/conscience. I call it "salvation through transformation."

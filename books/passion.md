Susan Patterson is an author of the heart and writer for the soul. Her work, it has been said, is so sharp, so intricate, that it is like a Faberge egg. Ms. Patterson's audience is worldwide and declares her writing to be in the top caliber of modern poets. Her work, which ranges from humorous to thoughtfully intelligent, is always quietly compelling.

Ms. Patterson has authored two books of tea poetry, one book and a CD of contemporary poetry, and a book of prose memoirs. This, her latest work, Passions, is a collection of her poems which speak for and from the heart of humanity. The poetry presented in Passions may be at times sexual, at times bawdy, but mostly loving and respectful in our efforts to be better individuals.

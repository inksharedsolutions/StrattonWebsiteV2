Esther was a mischievous and conniving little girl who craved attention. She was very good at making up stories for her friends to cover up her flaws. Esther had, among other things, a terrible fear of going to the dentist.

Before too long, her teeth began turning a turquoise green from the decay. She managed to convince her friends that green teeth were cool, and they could be cool too if they colored their teeth as well. She even had them call her Turquie after the new color of her teeth.

That adventure became short-lived as she was forced to visit the dentist. He managed to show her that visits to the dentists could actually be pain-free and was a good idea for proper health and to maintain a bright smile. She now was able to attract attention not from her bizarre stories, but from her winning personality and big bright smile.

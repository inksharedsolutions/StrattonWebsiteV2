When a war-hungry barbarian clan overtakes an enemy's fortress, they cut it off from all aid and strand the survivors nearby in a dark forest. However, as a single captive challenges the beliefs of two of the barbarians, they are sent into a conflict greater than they were ever prepared for. Trapped by their own devices, they must now battle alongside the men they stranded in a desperate attempt to thwart the very army they once belonged to. They are outnumbered and ill equipped, yet they are each spurred on by a rising conviction. Their plan is far from foolproof, but the renewal they seek cannot come at a small price. This is the story of how these two men were destroyed.

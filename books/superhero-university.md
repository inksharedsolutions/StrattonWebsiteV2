Are superheroes real? Superheroes are not only real, but anyone can become one! With Superhero University’s Ultimate Superhero Training Manual, you can earn a degree in Superheroism and become an official superhero in only forty-three lessons! Many are called, but few are qualified. Do you have what it takes to be a superhero? 

A long time ago, Harbinger was not a hero; he had been a lost soul enslaved to evil, dwelling in the darkness of everlasting death. One day, however, a superhero showed up, holding a lantern of love-light. Attracted to the light, Harbinger followed the superhero to the Bridge at the Edge of Darkness. It was there at the Bridge that Harbinger learned he could possess this light himself. After crossing the Bridge, Harbinger was introduced to Supreme, who gave Harbinger his superpowers. And now, with years of superhero experience, Harbinger is passing on the wisdom given to him by Supreme. Who is Harbinger? He is one of the faculty members of Superhero University.

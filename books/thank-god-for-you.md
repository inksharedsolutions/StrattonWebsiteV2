I am not ashamed to admit, that I prayed to God each time to send me a wonderful wife. I was never disappointed and will continue to communicate with Him on a regular basis.

After losing two wonderful wives, thank God that I received inspiration to write poetry.

There are three sections:

1. Finding Love - Meeting someone and falling in love
2. Cherishing love - All the years spent together, through thick and thin and all the ups and down of any relationship
3. Losing love - Losing a spouse or long-time partner is a terrible tragedy. Handling and understanding this loss is what keeps us going. Sometimes, as in my case, I was able to find love again. Then, she too died.

The inspiration for the poetry comes from many sources. A thought while driving or a thought that comes while watching something on television. In one case it was an incident that inspired me. I will on occasion place somewhere on the poem, what it was that inspired the poem.

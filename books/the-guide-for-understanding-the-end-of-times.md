The Guide for Understanding the End of Times is about viewing the New Covenant in its proper context. Once the clues are in order, the whole picture becomes clear, and we see the end-times correctly. Currently, there are numerous end-times theories because there are numerous denominations, having their own perspective. However, the first disciples showed us what the end-times is about when they asked Jesus, “When will you restore the kingdom to Israel?” This is the perspective we need because it matches the Old Testament, the focus of the prophets, the New Covenant context, and the new Jerusalem details.

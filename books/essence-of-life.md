This book takes you on the journey of my life. These poems are reflections of various situations that you may or may not personally encounter.

I strive to take you with me on these adventures as we experience love, prejudice, hate, and war-just to name a few.

My goal is to share with you my experience and encourage you to use them as motivation to continue your journey. Don't sit and cry about the things you have been through. Instead, look back, laugh, and reflect on what you have learned and how you have grown. It is not about what you did or did not do, it's about how you pick yourself up and push to be better than you were the day before. Enjoy and stay tuned for part 2.

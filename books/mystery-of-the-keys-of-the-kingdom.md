Keys are an important part of our lives. I once heard someone say that the more keys you hold, the more power you have. I don't know about that, but those keys give you access into locked places that keeps everyone else out.

This book will reveal a mystery that, in my mind, will open the locked understanding of what Jesus was telling Peter in Matthew 16:19 when He said, "I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven".

There are two important words in what Jesus told Peter. They are "keys of". Jesus was about to depart from earth through His crucifixion, death, and resurrection. He wanted to leave not only His disciples but all believers with tools or weapons to defeat the strategies of Satan. He delivered them to the disciples when He declared them to Peter. He said, "I will give you the keys of the Kingdom". That is much different than "keys to the kingdom". Jesus is the Key to the kingdom. But the keys of the kingdom are important to know.

In this book, you will find five very important keys to fight in the spirit realm. The rest of the paragraph is fine. You may have known about them but putting these simple but extremely important tools in your toolbox will help you to live the life Jesus said in John 10:10. I have come that they may have life and that they may have it more abundantly.

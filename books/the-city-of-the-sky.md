In the mid-twenty-seventh century, humanity exists as two distinct civilizations separated by the vacuum of space. Content in their isolation, the Ozzaens, inheritors of the grand orbital city of Ansenar, virtually ignore their distant cousins on Earth. But things are about to change...

The mysterious Circularium Council has carefully manipulated events, bringing the long-estranged cultures into contact again. Their motives are unclear-and there are those who fear the change and seek to undermine it for their own ends.

Thrust into this volatile situation is young Sean Kenzie, the Ô¨Årst Ozzaen ambassador, who discovers that he holds the key to a power much greater than he ever imagined. Sean quickly learns that political intrigue and diplomacy are dangerous-and deadly-games. Now, Sean must uncover the secret to his destiny, knowing that the fate of both civilizations rests in his hands.

A skillful blend of rich detail and human emotion, The City of the Sky deftly portrays one man's ultimate battle between good and evil in an ever-changing world.

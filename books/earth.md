This is a story of identical twin brothers who assist God in defending the Earth, as well as the entire universe, against the assaults of Satan and his minions. It is set in Heaven, Earth, and many planets and star systems throughout the universe. The brothers embark on God's assignments with the help of the archangels and many ancient Holy Relics. The brothers defend the Earth and planet after planet from the relentless attacks by Satan. Each attack is thwarted by the ingenuities of the brothers and the archangels.

This is Linda's first venture into the world of story writing. It began when she woke up with an idea. She wanted to write about heaven and how it should look. The ideas came fast and furious, and it was difficult for her to keep up with them as she committed to paper those ideas. Writing this book has been a labor of love, and she hopes that all who read it will enjoy the experience.

She started this book after retiring with thirty years in public health as a registered nurse. She wanted to write something different than her daily writing, and this book is the result.

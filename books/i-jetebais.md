"A high-fantasy account of reality as seen by one of Satan's brothers, sure to appeal to lovers of both fantasy and Christian literature."

\-Kirkus Reviews

"I, Jetebais becomes an almost revolutionary text. The book does not pretend to know or preach easy answers to life's struggles, nor offer comforting remarks on why evil exists. And in that alone lies the genius behind the fiction. Choosing to seek atonement for one's actions is a very personal journey fraught with self-doubt, fear, and mistrust. It is this experience which shapes who we are, and who we become. And as I, Jetebais shows, the cleansing and redemptive power of such a quest can rival that of any evil on earth, no matter how sinister. Fans of mythology and Christian writings will surely find something to love about Bishop's groundbreaking saga."

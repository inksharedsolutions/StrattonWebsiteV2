During a horrendous storm upon the North Sea, these Mariners sailed with all their might and courage and braved the icy waves towards a fjord on the east coast of Denmark. Their sail had been tethered and so the oarsmen rowed the vessel 'Thorknorr' towards some 'mudflats' into a cove where they anchored the longboat. These tribes from 700AD were self - sufficient and demonstrate how they foraged and built a temporary longhouse in the Aspen forest. It describes how these tribes were able to survive some of the most freezing cold conditions. Their faith in the Spirit Thor of the sky and the Spirits Aegir and Ran protected them during the winter while they built their settlement before sailing home again, when the season changed into Spring. They lit fires along the shingle beach to guard them from the Arctic fox and scribed upon Runes to leave signs for any other Sea-faring mariners.

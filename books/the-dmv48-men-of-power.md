The time has come to celebrate black men. They stand on the shoulders of Kings and Queens; not pimps and pawns. They often carry the burdens of an entire race with grace and dignity, never complaining and always ready to move every mountain that stands in the way of success. Many have accomplished so much with so little fanfare, often hidden in the shadows of time and a society that fears them rather than elevate them. Now more than ever, black men need to stand up and be counted. Now more than ever, we must transform our thinking to know that these fathers aren't deadbeats, but determined to make it in the midst of what is often insurmountable odds. We shine a light on great men who have and are doing great things in the Washington Metropolitan Area. We bet you didn't know local black men had accomplished so much with so little fanfare. These are their stories and this is their legacy and labor of love that shall be etched in annals of time.

Leah Brown, a wife and mother from San Francisco, decides to spend time at a small cabin built in Idaho territory in the late 1860's by her great, great grandparents, Linnea and Thaddeus Milton. She debates further debilitating treatments for her illness, something that has precluded her being able to spend time with her husband Ned and two sons, away in summer camp. Her memories of childhood and the tragic loss of her father stir her mind, especially when she discovers Linnea's long-hidden diary. As she reads and rereads it and begins to explore the world around her, she gains perspective on the challenges women have always faced. She honors the pioneer's words and imagines Linnea's unwritten thoughts. Leah experiences a surprisingly different time in the old cabin than she expected.

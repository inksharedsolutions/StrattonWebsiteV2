Today, we live in a society where many adults in the middle generation have self-destructed. Their behavior is very disturbing and confusing to those around them. Due to their reckless and odd behaviors, grandparents (their parents) are put in the position of having to care for the children of the middle generation parents. The middle generation absenteeism has put a tremendous strain on society that has and will cause a deep impact for generations to come. This book spells out the reasons for this malady and offers solutions.

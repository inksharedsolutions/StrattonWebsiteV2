Heart to Heart Considered Sentiments for Tea Time is a collection of thoughts and verses not only suitable for tea time, but it is a book of sensibilities that are suitable for a life time. Just as special blends of tea contain delicious subtleties of taste, this book contains intriguing subtleties of insight and wisdom. Susan Patterson (aka Earlene Grey) writes of everyday life, sometimes lifting it to the spiritual, and sometimes grounding it to the practical.

Heart to Heart is presented in a series of small trilogies. Each set of pages contains two Earleneisms (or "tea sips" as some like to say) and one poem. On the surface one might think that they are not connected. But if one considers and ponders a moment, the nuances of the message will come through. In addition, each reader may discover his or her own personal message, but after all, isn't that the point of poetry?

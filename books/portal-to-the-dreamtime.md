The way you tell your story is fascinating and detail-oriented making your readers feel they were actually there. You share an eye-opening account of the gift that you have. The experiences that you and your friends have is something totally new. It shows a painful and very hurtful recount of what man has done to environment and who (or what) are suffering because of all these wrongdoings.

Readers also learn quite a number of life lessons. For example, the values of trusting ourselves, trusting our spirits, taking responsibility and accountability for our experiences. All these help readers become better and stronger people in general.

Basically the book is a very interesting read. It can actually make one think about what they have done to either help or destroy Mother Earth. It makes people think twice about their actions and what consequences they could lead to.

John Koch graduated from Melbourne University in 1958 with a degree in engineering. Soon after purchasing a 223 acre property close to Melbourne, he became aware of numerous artefacs and ceremonial sites used by the original indigenous inhabitants. He also became aware, as did many friends and visitors, of the presence of aboriginal spirits. Some could see them. Charles could hear them speak.

Wharumbidgi introduced himself as guardian spirit of the sacred site. He explained that he lived on the land about 400 years ago. He was instrumental, with the help of ascended masters, in the creation of a Portal for the purpose of releasing aboriginal spirits who were stuck in the fourth dimension astral plane. This followed the devastation they experienced after the arrival of Europeans. The higher frequency dimension to which they moved they called the Dreamtime.

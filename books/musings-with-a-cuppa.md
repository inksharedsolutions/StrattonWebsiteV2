Musings with a Cuppa - The Poetry of Tea is an invitation to experience the joy and serenity of a freshly brewed pot of tea, stirred and steeped just so, then blended perfectly with the wit and wisdom of captivating poetry.

Since the introduction of the written word, poetry has been used to uniquely convey impressions of the ordinary as well as the extraordinary. It is only natural then that this form of writing should find its way into the elegance, subtlety and graciousness of taking tea.

Musings With a Cuppa is a collection of original poems dedicated to those who not only understand the complexity of creating a fine cuppa, but who also appreciate the simplicity of its enjoyment. Although a product of the 20th century, each poem embodies the flavor and spirit of Edwardian England. From the very beginning of the first verse, the reader is taken back to the early 1900s where a gracious society was built on civility and decorum.

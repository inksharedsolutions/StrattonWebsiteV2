Often, observes Roger K. Holcomb, people do not allow themselves to experience the wholeness of life. So the life experience may have started with him as a small lad, working along with his grandfather, Amos Brady Westfall.

As his grandfather worked several jobs, a schoolteacher in a one-room school, Jackson County, West Virginia, a blacksmith, and also a farmer. Growing up, he went to school and finished in 1970. Then, he moved to Ohio and worked and met his wife, Fraun. Two years went by, then they had their first son.

He worked in small Assembly of God churches. He was also working to become a minister. Later, their two other children were born. The three children's names are Roger, Shawna, Brady, and they are married and blessed us with ten grandchildren and all working in church.

From 1990 to 1995, he pastored a small independent church for five years. From 1995 to 2002, he pastored an independent church in West Virginia Conference and Hosten Conference in Virginia.

Roger Holcomb resides in Radford, Virginia, today with his family and friends.

Olivia Clayton is a work-from-home book editor. Alyssa Walton is a forest ranger in western Montana. The two have been best friends--actually more like sisters--all of their lives. They've shared all their life experiences, including birthdays. This year, in the middle of Alyssa's birthday celebration, she is run down by a black Humvee.

While Alyssa fights for her life, Olivia, crushed by grief, works to figure out who would want to kill her friend and why. She remembers conversations she and Alyssa had before and enlists the help of Detective Sheldon. Together they figure out that Alyssa's brush with death is the result of a chance meeting in the nearby forest.

As local man Joe Little Hawk comes under suspicion, Olivia fights her growing romantic feelings for Sheldon. Meanwhile, she thwarts an attempt on Alyssa's life at the hospital and becomes a target herself. A final standoff in the dark forest could mean someone might end up dead.

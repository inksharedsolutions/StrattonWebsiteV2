"Sometimes when the chips are down, all you need is a wild card."

Star Team Seven has lost more than just their ship, they lost their captain. Hammer has been transported into the past during the most pivotal moment in Earth's history, the Gray War. What's worse, is that Hammer could very well change the course of history of left unchecked. Acting captain, Tivex and the remaining crew of Team Seven must now use the Horizon to go back in time, find Hammer and stop him from making a universe changing choice. Their only option? Steal back the mysterious ship, the Horizon, while breaking out one of the most dangerous criminals in the IEC territory, and hope she will agree to help Team Seven find Hammer. The fate of the universe and time itself are on a razor's edge and the clock is already ticking.

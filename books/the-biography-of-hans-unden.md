Born in 1943, Hans describes his life as an executive chef with a worldwide reputation. Although he started his career as a struggling refugee from Czech Republic, his life bloomed despite difficult circumstances. With the help of established author, Joanna Jakubcin, the story unfolds from the ruins of World War II in Hassmersheim, Germany, to the start-up of Disney World in Orlando, Florida. With many stops and starts along the way, Hans's true story shows the reader how a small boy with scoliosis can defeat the odds and gain success.

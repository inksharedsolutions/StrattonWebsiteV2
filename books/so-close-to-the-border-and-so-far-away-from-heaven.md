The border has always been a hot topic, especially these days. The stories shared in this book are just a small sample of what can occur to any individual on either side of the wall. They were meant to entertain but are also a reflection of the struggles some may encounter and were written to help those in need of change. These stories might not help solve the current problems in our world, but through common human decency, we should be able to be more considerate and compassionate of our neighbors instead of putting up walls and finding excuses to hate. To our problems, love will always find a way.

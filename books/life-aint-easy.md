Justin Williamson (thirteen) is a typical small-town boy who is about to discover some of life's hardest lessons. Everything can change in the blink of an eye. Everything can be taken away.

Justin's parents have filed for divorce, and things are going to get interesting. It does not take long for things to be ripped apart. It's amazing how fast new characters can be introduced in your life whether you are ready or not. Whether positive or negative, they are here to stay.

With his bestie Michelle, their friendship can survive anything, or can't it? A summer from an elementary school to a high school and a new place in a new town. It's only a few miles, how much could things change?

We follow Justin on his journey to his first job, driver's license, and other firsts as he grows and is shaped by his surroundings. Every person that enters our lives are there for a purpose. We have something to learn from them. What lessons are in store for Justin?

Everything he knows will be put to the test, even his own faith and sanity.

How do you handle bullying, betrayal of a family member or a "friend," abuse, and suicide by a friend or loved one? What do you do when you don't have a support network? How do you make relationships that last? Will it take a miracle or do those even exist?

Justin has to learn to trust his gut, wits, and to learn to believe in himself in order to survive. In the end the person you have to trust the most is yourself. We are faced with many challenges and decisions in our lives. Some for the better and some for the worst.

Your support network is important, and if you don't think you have one, get one. Not all friends are friends. Even a family member may have it in for you. If you are unsure whom to trust, trust a professional. There are services out there that may be even free to help you along.

Justin reaches out several times throughout his journey and so should you. Not all problems can be solved alone or totally solved at all.

Life's pressures and tribulations can affect you in many ways including those around you. Ever sit with negative people at a table? Try it as an experiment. It won't take long for you to join them in the negativity. Now sit with positive people and see what happens. How does it make you feel after each one?

There is a saying that when times are good, you are surrounded by many who care. See who are there when times are not good.

Justin's journey will take you there through thick and thin as he develops from a thirteen-year-old boy to the man he is today. His relationships are molded through learning as are yours. Life never stops teaching us so never stop learning.

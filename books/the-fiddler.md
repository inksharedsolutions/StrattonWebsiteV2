Ralph Mullen takes his grandson on a fishing trip to enjoy some quality time with his namesake. He is asked to help seek and destroy what he believes is a nest of the venomous brown recluse spider, and his grandson volunteers for the both of them. Unfortunately, a simple location and elimination of a nest of spiders turns into a multiple murder that endangers Ralph's and his grandson's lives.

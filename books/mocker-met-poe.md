This is a tale about a little mockingbird and his relationship with a not-so-common human-raised crow by the name of Poe. They lived in a quiet wooded suburban neighborhood with grass, bushes, and trees and lots of bird feeders and baths. Their story should have been one of being content and happy, but no. Their story was one of growing up and facing all the struggles of life and living together and learning how to help and be helped, accepting others-friends and strangers alike-and dealing with a murder of crows called the Black Bandits.

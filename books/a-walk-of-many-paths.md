A Walk of Many Paths is the first book from former foster kid and survivor David Ferguson. A collection focused on the good, the bad, and the ugly experiences of a narrator who had to bide his time until he was lucky enough to escape the foster care system. A Walk of Many Path is the unofficial story of someone who had to make the important decision to walk away from his mentally ill family at the age of twelve because the Ministry of Children and Family Development was too incompetent to see the reality of this boy's situation.

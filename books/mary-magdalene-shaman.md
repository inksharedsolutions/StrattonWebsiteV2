A Good Book for Our Current Times.

After emerging out of the pandemic and experiencing the number of deaths, disappointments and grief, the book "Mary Magdalene, Shaman" contains a healing and hopeful message for anyone going through a challenging time, after 2020. It is a story of faith, passion and transformation.

At 62, Sara was faced with having to have a liver transplant if she wanted to live. Not knowing if she would get one because they were scarce, her intense prayer work with her community of women, and a twelve hour ritualistic shamanic healing in the Arizona desert facilitated a miraculous gift of a new liver and a successful transplant.

Today at age 86, she has lived long enough to welcome seven grandchildren and three great grandchildren. Her prayers were answered!

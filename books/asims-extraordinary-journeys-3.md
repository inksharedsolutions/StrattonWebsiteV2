In a magical time where monsters, warlocks, and wicked kings rule the lands, a quiet night in a small village life is shattered. A king's army, riding in on horseback, snatch up all the male children, shackling them to a raggedy cart. They disappear back into the darkness where they came from, leaving most villagers dead and their houses burning.

A small group of surviving villagers set out in search of Asim, a warrior known to help the oppressed. After he agrees to help, they all embark on an extraordinary journey crossing through thick forests, expansive rivers, and great mountains and encountering dragons, monsters, goblins, dwarfs, and witches who continually put their lives in jeopardy. They recruit an assortment of female warriors, dwarfs, and robbers along the way to the king's castle, where they have to fight an army and a warlock to rescue the children.

The overall theme of the book is a metaphorical depiction of Peter walking and sinking on the water symbolizing the essence of life for all of us. That as we walk or tread upon the serpentine waters of life, if distracted by menacing trials and tribulations can find ourselves sinking in the murky waters of doubt and fear and in need of Christ to save us. The book equates the deterioration of society in general with the deterioration of the family in particular. The backbone of society is the family and the strength of the family is the Church. Lord, Save Me chronicles this message from a wide range of perspectives.

The author is married with children and lives in a small town in rural Mississippi. He is a pastor and a bishop in the body of Christ. He holds a Doctorate in Theology; is a student but not a graduate of the Bible. His internship as a servant in life and his graduation will commence when Jesus raptures the Church.

Unnoticed Moments is a collection of poetry from writer Susan Patterson, spanning the years 2010-2014. Her work, characterized by its simplicity and clarity, reveals the multiple levels of human nature. Mrs. Patterson captures that which would seem ordinary, if not mundane, and transmutes it into global meaning. She writes about the frailties of humanity, yet offers hope. She writes about daily life and almost dares the reader to act upon the truths that are in the soul of each us.

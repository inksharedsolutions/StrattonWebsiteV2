It was exciting for us to develop this book by creating words and illustrations to go along with the letters, using hockey as a backdrop. In the making of this book, we have learned that you can accomplish anything that you put your mind to. You will never get anywhere or accomplish anything without at least trying and doing something you are passionate about. Let us all look for God's blessing in whatever we do.

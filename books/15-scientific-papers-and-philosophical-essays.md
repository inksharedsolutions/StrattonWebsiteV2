This book is challenging our orthodox view concerning the world. Failure to understand existence, humans live by instinct, and life has become tragedy and misery. Humans are more than animals, and the book is shedding light upon human beings, their behaviors, and the society they have created.

Our world is divided between religion and science. Religious people know the inward man. Scientists apprehend the physical body but have no clue concerning what is moving the body. This compilation of articles is discussing how the inner system interacts with the physical body to create our realities. And the new tool that studies such interaction is called quantum biology

While he was still a cadet at Ecole Navale in France, Daniel Zanou inherited the philosophical works of the French mathematician and philosopher Rene Descartes. Ten years later, he emigrated to the United States of America where he studied Emergency Medicine at Butler Tech in Ohio. He has become an independent researcher in quantum biology and continues his writings in philosophy. In 2018, he got his citizenship and worked since then as a truck driver over the road while carrying his research part-time.

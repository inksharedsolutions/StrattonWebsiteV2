Merlin, the time traveler from the days of King Arthur, moved on to the Shakespeare period in Merlin's Shakespeare Encounter. In this book, he is moved on again to the period of the French Revolution and Madame Guillotine aiding the landed gentry to escape France.

After Napoleon's coup, Merlin arrives at the battle of Waterloo to help Wellington before moving on to Winston Churchill's early life in Sudan and South Africa, finalizing in World War II, where he meets the young Princess Elizabeth on her experience at Victory in Europe day.

Malcolm John Baker was born in Salisbury, England, in 1945. By trade he was a chartered surveyor and practiced in South London, England. Now retired, he lives in Florida, USA, enjoying the sunshine.

He has now written six books, which are inspired by his extensive travels and current affairs. He endeavors to include historic incidents in his books and write a fictional story around that.

This is the third book in the Merlin series of time travel. The next project is his film production of Daylight Robbery. He is excited by this change of career. The film will be released in spring 2020. Please visit my website, malcolmjohnbaker.com. The next book is about a clone; watch this space.

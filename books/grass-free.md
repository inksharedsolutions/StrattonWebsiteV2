Ancient eating.

There were no grasses in the ancient diet.

For some 1.8 million years, as the upright Homo erectus, we hunted and gathered food.

Then, about 10,000 years ago, with the agricultural revolution, grasses were introduced into the modern diet. (Grass seeds were never eaten.)

These grasses, mainly wheat, sugar cane, and corn, are responsible for the new "diseases of civilization" arthritis, arteriosclerosis, cancer, asthma, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, etc.

The body just can't process grasses properly.

Grasses cause inflammation, health problems, and then an early death. This was news to me!

Hence, GRASS-FREE: my discovery of what is good, and what is not good, for the body.

What does ministry look like in a 2,800-employee beef-processing plant? Chaplain Heidi takes you by the hand as she gently pulls back the thin layer of veneer of real experiences with Muslims, Christians, languages, cultures, customs, traditions, and a splash of corporate policy. It's a merry-go-round of colorful stories with emotional highs and lows punctuated with laughter. "If we can see each other as people, not a label, it changes the way we see the world. I'm a mom, and that Muslim woman is a mom. Now we're seeing each other through the same lens of life's camera. I want others to meet the people I love, care about, and minister to."

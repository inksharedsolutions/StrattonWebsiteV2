This book is a short health guide based on new scientific findings that our bodies are built on a foundation of energy. We are learning through research that spiritual qualities like love and hope, once considered as being outside of the realm of science, are in fact powerful factors in determining our health. Science cannot say that we are spiritual in nature, but it is not a great stretch to conclude that our essence is spiritual. Whether we make that stretch or not, responsibility for our own health is clearer than ever before. Your health is not something that can be maintained by anyone else. The most important factor in the quality of your health is how well you take care of yourself. Tim's Story sets the stage for this new paradigm of health.

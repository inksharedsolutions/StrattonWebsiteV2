The book Chasing Dreams entails a unique story, though premised on a known maxim that life, in essence, is a bundle of aspirations and frustrations. Unlike most other literary commentaries, this story has no predominant character dictating the flow of events. Most major players in the story play prevailing roles when portraying their respective charisma, for that moment giving impressions about their respective dominant roles in the context of the story.

Azeem's decision to join the Pakistan army against the inclination of his loving Dada-ji (grandfather), his following shattered dreams, and the denial of his career progression in the Bangladesh army were successive debacles. In pursuing life, Shafiq, the much younger cousin of Azeem, played a unique role and discharged his responsibilities, as per the teachings of Dada-ji, in fulfilling the desires of the Madrasah-educated but very rural Dada-ji concerning the family. The story revolves around Dada-ji and his love and care for his grandsons, Azeem and Shafiq, and his granddaughter, Julaikha.

The uniqueness of the story is manifested in the love and support of the Pakistan army's Captain Riaz, the kindness and consideration shown by Babu Bijon Mohan Nag in trusting an unknown young Muslim man in the persona of Dada-ji, and the exceptional flexibility demonstrated by the dance teacher, Shibnath Bishwash, in accommodating Muslim Bijli and her grandma consequent to their home being gutted. Bijli portrayed the life and living of Jatra (a form of folk theater) party girls, was in love with Shafiq's father and youngest son of Dada-ji, Rakib, both to be victims of a boat capsize.

The story epitomizes the death of Azeem, the brutal murder of his son, Fazal, in a paramilitary-armed revolt, and the kidnapping of his growing grandson, Ameen. In all variable situations, life was never abandoned, and Rukiya, the wife of Azeem, nurtured and carried the torch of family dreams. She upheld that while saying Khuda-Hafeez to a loving grandson on his way to a higher education abroad. Life moves on with new hopes and dreams.

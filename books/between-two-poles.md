This story is one that belongs to the Author's "Lessons the Key of Life." This time the author reels the reader in with the story of a family who have been living in the home with a parent with an unstable personality disorder. The oldest child who describes life with a sick parent, renders the story. The children have managed to stay afloat, even with Mom's relapses into instability. There are many real symptoms, and coping mechanisms described as clues in managing real life brushes with mental illness. Most of all the message is: life can be happy and normal even with such a complicated illness. It is a family disease and can be treated that way.

This book, Almost to Heaven, by Jean is written to thank the community, church, hospital, and Jean's family for all that was accomplished while working together with Jean's emergency care one important morning. These values brought Jean back into realizing the importance of why she is here on earth.

The book is an account of Jean's Near-Death Experience with God. Jean died on August, 26, 2013 and was given another chance of life on August 28, 2013, because of the expertise of Dr. Jeff Rayl with the New Ulm' Medical Center and Dr. Tim Henry at Abbott Northwestern Hospital in the cities.

Jean's life was given back because of more than the medical care she received. It was through her husband, Rod; daughters, Louise and Rose; sisters; parents; aunts; uncles; cousins; nieces; and nephews; and church, co-workers, friends, neighbors that showed Jean what can happen when a community works together and how the power of prayer truly works.

This book is written as well to remind the media how positive stories can always develop from stories/experiences if we choose to work together even in a smaller community for the good of the whole, the sake of one person.

For those reading this story, please know, your prayers will always be remembered in my heart. It is three years since the time this experience happened. Even though the book is technically finished, the story continues as Jean pledges to serve the New Ulm community and God, while distributing and setting up the most precious gift we have on earth, the Real Presence of Jesus in the Eucharist while being in Full Communion of the Catholic Church!

PLEASE KNOW THAT NO MATTER WHAT AREA OF LIFE I'M LIVING, IT'LL BE LIVED IN FULL COMMUNION OF THE CHURCH TO GLORIFY GOD'S NAME! MAY ONLY GOOD COME OUT OF THIS BOOK!

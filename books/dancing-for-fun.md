Dancing is a universal and primal form of expression, and it is something we can all enjoy. What’s more, it’s a healthy and fun way to bring more exercise into our lives. Anyone, at any age, can enjoy group dancing, from the very young children to senior citizens.

This guide presents a series of original group dances inspired by both folk and contemporary dances. It focuses on dance as a way for anyone and everyone to engage in movement while having fun and interacting with others.

Author Mark L. Greathouse, in collaboration with his wife, Helena, offers original piano compositions and professionally written choreography designed to match the music exactly. To further aid in learning the dances, this teaching tool also provides links to online videos demonstrating each dance and the music to go with it.

Improve your coordination, bring more movement into your life, and have fun with dancing! Dancing for Fun can show you how.

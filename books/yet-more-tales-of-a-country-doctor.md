Yet More Tales of a Country Doctor is the third in Carter's trilogy of stories drawn from his much-loved rural practice, where he served the local community as their doctor for thirty-three years. The stories, which are all drawn from true events, reflect the very personal, as well as equal, relationships which are a feature of country life. Like life itself, many of these stories are simultaneously both funny and sad. Yet More Tales of a Country Doctor, through the exploits of the various characters, explores many of the issues which face us all, and celebrates the indomitable spirit of every day heroes in overcoming whatever obstacles might lie in their way.

As with the two earlier books in the trilogy ("Tales of a country doctor", and "The further tales of a country doctor"), this collection of stories will keep you highly entertained, and stay in your mind for a long time to come.

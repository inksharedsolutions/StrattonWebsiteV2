Susan Patterson, whose occasional nom de plume is Earlene Grey, is the author of four poetry books, Musings With a Cuppa - The Poetry of Tea, Heart to Heart - Considered Sentiments for Teatime, Unnoticed Moments, and Passions. Ms. Patterson has a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and a Master's degree in business administration. Although writing had always been a pleasure for her, she did not take up the pen as an artistic endeavor until 2001. Ms. Patterson soon found out that her reflections on life struck a significant chord with people around the world. She is delighted to continue writing both poetry and historical essays. Susan Patterson currently enjoys a quiet and somewhat reclusive life in the Pacific Northwest, with her husband, James.

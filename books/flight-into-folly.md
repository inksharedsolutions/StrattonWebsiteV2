This is a fictional account of one man's attempt to give some meaning and scope to his life by involving himself in the Vietnam conflict during the dying years of it. As well, it covers the years of tortured regret that followed. To the attuned reader, it will also indicate the parallels between that conflict and the one that more recently took place in Iraq and Afghanistan.

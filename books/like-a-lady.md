Cali Thomas has been alone her whole life. She's never had parents but has been to just about every foster home in the state. By a chance of fate, Cali discovers that she is very talented at placekicking for her high school football team and gets signed to play for Carrington State University. Between sharing a dorm with nine other boys, having to change in a closet, and keeping up an academic scholarship, Cali has her hands full. Fortunately, she meets Jason Pitt, a quarterback protégé who somehow manages to keep up with her. Together, they venture through Cali's first year of adulthood and take their team right to the edge of success.

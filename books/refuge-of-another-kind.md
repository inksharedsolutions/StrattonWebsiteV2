Through a simple act of good will, Mack Thomas puts himself, his wife, and the rest of his family on the target list of two evil men and their followers, a religious cult. His wife is made a special target, although an elusive one.

Several women are also targeted: Women considered by the religious cult to be uppity. Women who refuse to be subservient to men, simply because they are men. At the same time, seniors are being murdered, only for the joy of the killing and the blood.

Mack and the rest of the Clayborne County Sheriff's Department find the solutions beyond the scope of normal police work-solutions they are determined to find.

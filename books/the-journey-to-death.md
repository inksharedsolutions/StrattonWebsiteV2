The book explains briefly the way what it took for the writer to get to the Arabian Gulf waters of Yemen, starting from the long-distance heart of Ethiopia. After that, he talks of his childhood villages on the way to Jijiga, the eastern city of Ethiopia, and then to the port city of Bosaso. But he passed a lot of difficulties on his journey.

It is difficult to track how many days the writer spent. He spent seventy-one hours walking in the Sahara Desert without food and water before crossing the Gulf of Aden. In those circumstances, days and nights lacked meaning. One can hardly tell what day of the week is any given day. All that matters is getting there at all cost.

However, the most dangerous trip was the perilous fourty-one-hour journey in the waters of the Arabian Gulf. People are crammed into a rickety boat made for a dozen people. Some of the stories told in this fateful journey are too gruesome to mention. Suffice to say, it is a life-and-death situation. The harsh circumstances, however, hardly deter refugees from getting to their destination.

Consciousness is something that is very difficult to define and study scientifically. It is a topic that is often discussed in philosophy, but, by its supposed nature, it is considered to be a "soft science." This book is written with the intent of identifying what the actual nature of consciousness might be and to determine how consciousness might relate to the overall cosmos. Using data derived from what is known scientifically and from what has been theorized, both scientifically and philosophically, a hypothetical model describing Cosmic Consciousness is developed and illustrated. Propositions are derived from what is known about the cosmos and consciousness, and they are discussed in relation to the model in order to provide some exciting possibilities as to how humans, God, religion, and purpose might fit into the cosmos, in general. The reader may reference these propositions to use as input to his/her own effort to determine what the cosmos and the human experience may be all about.

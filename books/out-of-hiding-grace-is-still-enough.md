Have you ever had a blanket of darkness come over you so that you feared surviving?  Have you ever felt so helpless and hopeless that tomorrow was a burden to bear, not a day to anticipate?  Human suffering is a complex and devastating experience.  In Out of Hiding: Grace is Still Enough, Dr. Barbara Kathleen Welch examines the Nazi Holocaust and child abuse as the benchmarks of ultimate human suffering—suffering imposed on an innocent person through the hideous atrocities of others.  Out of Hiding takes the reader into the inner workings of the human condition.  It also encourages us with the good news that there is hope, and it is found in the power of God’s grace as God works through healers.  You will be inspired as you see God taking care of the most wounded of those who have been reduced and depersonalized at the hands of others.

God desires a relationship with all mankind. Sin broke that relationship between God and man. Jesus' death and resurrection opened the door to restore that relationship and connected heaven and earth in a unique way. *The Prayer of Agreement* is written for both clergy and laity to access God's promises and reposition themselves in God purposes in reaching our world in prayer.



Imagine what would happen if every believer took the promises of God seriously. Then imagine being armed with the Word of God and joined with others in prayer who are expecting the will of God to be accomplished on earth as it is in heaven. When God's church becomes the house of prayer, it would be empowered and produce results. As a believer, explore the promises of God that results from *the prayer of agreement*. This world can be touched with the reality of a living God, active in our world.

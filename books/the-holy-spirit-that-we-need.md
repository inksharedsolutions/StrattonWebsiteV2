The Holy Spirit is indeed subjected to the authority of God and will only work to fulfill His divine purpose. God uses Him to distribute gifts to the members of the body of Christ. There is a distinct role that's played by the Holy Spirit. The growth of the entire churches is absolutely dependent on the gifting and manifestation of the Holy Spirit as He is directed by God.

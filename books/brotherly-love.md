This author used the Holy Bible Easy to Read Version (ERV). Also, this author wanted to show you with three main points of his story from his personal experiences and/or obstacles. So, this book will tell us that:

1.God has a reason for all of the problems that we faced.

2.God makes a plan for you.

3.God has given this day to you.

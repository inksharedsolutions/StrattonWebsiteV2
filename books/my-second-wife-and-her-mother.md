After a period of time, William and Dora were married, and the newlyweds began a new life together. But there was trouble brewing, and it didn't take long for William to discover that everything he thought he knew was, in fact, a lie. In My Second Wife and Her Mother, William writes the true story about his marriage and the reason for its demise.

Join in his journey as he finds unconventional freedom through divorce.

He grew up in a small town called Louisville, Mississippi. There the population was six thousand people at the time, and there were no work in that city for graduating students. When he moved to Chicago, lifestyle work was much better for mankind. After making his way to the big-city life, he found work there within six months. Then four years later, he got married in Rochester, New York. He had a child on the way in December that year. He was drafted into the US Army Military, and his tour of duty was two years of active serve.

When he got out, he went back to work at his old job, where he had six years of seniority. He worked for them for six months before getting laid off permanently. Then he found more work until his retirement thirty-five years later. While working for that company, he used military service benefit to go to Purdue University Calumet to get his BSE degree in Mechanical Engineering Technological. He managed to work full time and went to school part and full time until graduating in 1989.

Six years later, he wrote Basic Math Concepts, a book with an easy system for students to learn decimals and fractions.

He always wanted to help in the educational field in mathematics, and his knowledge was limited for quite some time. While going to college in the midseventies, taking algebra, the spirit of God came into his life and gave him some breakthrough news for mankind, and that is what he wrote the math book on.

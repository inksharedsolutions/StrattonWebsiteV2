Mackellan Kirby, professor of ancient religious studies, with some ongoing connection to the British SAS, is enjoying retirement in Ireland when he discovers an anomaly in the Dead Sea Scroll he has been entrusted with translating. Always ready to solve any mystery, he enlists the aid of his American niece and nephew. Their search takes them to the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, in northern Spain, the goal of thousands of pilgrims every year. But their holiday jaunt immediately turns deadly when other factions become interested in their search. The artifact they recover, in the cellars of the cathedral, brings together writings from the first century AD about the charismatic leader who escaped from Judaea with his wife, Mary; the story of the eleventh-century bishop entrusted with the construction of the cathedral; and the truth of the conspiracy of St. James-a cover-up of a secret so significant that its exposure could rock the modern Christian church of its knees. If only Kirby and his young relatives live long enough.

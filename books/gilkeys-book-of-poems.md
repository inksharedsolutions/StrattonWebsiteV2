My book tells different parts of things that occurred during my life. Some things are interpreted and other things are just thoughts. I guess you would say I have a variety of different situations, which would range from fiction, nonfiction, fantasies that I daydreamed about or imagined could happen one day. I use different things in my poems to describe how my life is and was, some are happy and some are unhappy. There are several parts of my poems that in some way describe my feelings of when my mother passed away. I also included my experiences of when I lived in the projects, I could have been more graphic about the things I came across with some of the people I saw and the things they have, but that might have been a little too much to handle.

I also described one of my poems as a tiny monster with claws beneath the floors. That creature was a large rat, and that was a true story. My family and I had no choice but to live in that house, due to financial problems, because it possibly would have hurt my career if I left. Well, that's a short version of my poetry.

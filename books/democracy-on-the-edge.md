If you are interested in American Political Issues, you are going to love reading this book!

Trying to make sense of political issues in the United States can be challenging, especially with the "spin" placed on so many issues by media and politicians. If you are fed up with the lies and half-truths and want real answers, look no further!

Democracy on the Edge discusses these important issues:

The Supreme Court's decision on "Citizen's United"
How gun ownership is a right but has limitations
The effects of global warming (by W.K. Fifield, MD)
How health care issues affect all Americans
The influence of big business on American lives
Causes of the "Financial Crisis," and what Congress has done
The Tea Party and their conflicting views
America's deep debt and plans to dig out of it

While based on verifiable facts, Democracy on the Edge is also filled with Terry's flare for personal anecdotes and humorous quips that make the book delightful to read.

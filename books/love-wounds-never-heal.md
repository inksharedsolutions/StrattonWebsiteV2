This story reflects the relationship between two young people who met and fell in love in a very short period of time and did not take the time to know more about each other mainly due to the circumstances and time table of events, which you will read about in this story. They were thinking they would get married, raise their children, and live happily ever after. Little did they know the problems they would encounter, such as the involvement from members in the family, which would lead to the breakdown of their marriage, contributing to love wounds that never heal.

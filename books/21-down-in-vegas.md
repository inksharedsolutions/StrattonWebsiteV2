In the arena of sports fandom, it's easy to lose one's passion in a sea of failed decisions. There finally comes a time when 'desperation' becomes the houses' last seat at the table. In the most improbable game of 21, Cisco "The Dealer" Wheeler dares to make a gamble with no logic against the odds for one last chance to experience the thing he loved the most!

Steve Hayes and his love of baseball come honestly. As a formert player and student of the game, he authored the biography of Cincinnati Reds "super-scout" Gene Bennett and chronicled his 58 years with the team which became a "Red's Nation" best-seller.

For over fifty - years, Steve has enjoyed success in the radio business and has always considered himself just a story-teller at heart.

Born and raised in Southern Ohio, his radio travels have been through major markets such as Houston, Cincinnati, Louisville, Lexington, Ky. Daytona Beach, Jacksonville and Huntington, W.Va.

Returning to his hometown in 1999 to assume radio ownership, on-air hosting, and management of several local stations, it brought his career full- circle to begin a dormant passion he had always known was within; writing.

He began as a weekly columnist for the local paper for almost fifteen years during which time writing successful insights and books fueled his creativity and passion. Steve's last memoir in 2017 was titled "Snap Shots" which was a regional bestt-seller about pop personalities with all profit- proceeds being donated to the local no-kill mal shelter.

At home on a five acre farm on the Ohio River, fishing, traveling, and collecting as many stories as he can is still Steve's regular routine. Added to the list, he is still collecting yarns to tell and getting up at 4:00 am to host his popular morning radio program from 5am-10am on WNXT-FM and worldwide at

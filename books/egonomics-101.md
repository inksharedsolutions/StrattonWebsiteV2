This book is about my near-death experience and the message of honesty from the Great Spirit of life. My NDE happened in 2008, and it has taken me almost twelve years of research into psychology, politics, and religion to understand what I was exposed to in that death of my fragile ego/self. When this happened, I was at the top of my game, and in an instant, it was all gone. I had to learn how to communicate all over again. With a whole new perspective of both life and death and without any fear of either.

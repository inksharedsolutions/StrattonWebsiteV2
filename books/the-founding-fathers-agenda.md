The Founding Fathers’ Agenda is a response to the turmoil in the country during the 2016 presidential election. It is a glimpse into the mind of the Fathers who have led a solid foundation for a state of freedom.  The book comes to be witness to the people of the United States of America and the Founding Fathers who are still in control of the land, which has been secured after several agreements. The land was supposed to be a place where honey and milk should flow profusely so that a man could enjoy existence with a minimum of dignity opposing then, the agenda of the bloody kings of Europe.

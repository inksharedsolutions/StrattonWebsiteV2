God is omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent. The Bible tells of his powers and more. Everything we need to know to be saved are all in the Bible. Most people, though, think the Bible is simply a written recording of anecdotes of God and his interaction with humans and the testament of his power. That is, however, not all of it. The scholars have excluded the apocrypha, purposely preserving the teachings that are constant throughout the books in the Bible. This makes the Bible more than just the collection of the sacred texts from the days of God. The scholars have observed a system. The Bible Is a Single Book undertakes the project of explaining the outline and theme found in the Bible. This will pave way for readers to be further enlightened when studying the Bible for their salvation.

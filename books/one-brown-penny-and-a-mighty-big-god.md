One Brown Penny and a Mighty Big God is a collection of inspirational short stories. I call it my awakening from God. 

As a single mom, working two jobs at times, it was not always easy to know where our next meal would come from. Although I had family support and the support of friends, it was still difficult. In the midst of a sleepless night, awoken at 1:30 a.m., I began to write about a brown penny. I could not imagine why. But by 4:00 a.m., four pages of a book had been written. The irony was that the very next day, I had to count out $20 in pennies to go and buy something to eat, thus a story is born.

This penny would come to symbolize a time of feeling unworthy, broken, and during a time where if you didn’t have, you could associate your life to the “brown penny,” that feeling of being cast down or cast away. It was and remains an inspiration from the beginning to the end of how God can and will make a way to feed you, clothe you, and shelter you through your worst times.

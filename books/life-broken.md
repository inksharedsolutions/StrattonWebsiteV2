A real life story that happened to a young woman that helped to shape her life for the rest of her life. Love, drama, sexual misappropriations from a little girl barely four and a half years old until the age of adulthood. The tragedy that would happen to her was meant to kill her but she did not die, she made it. She is the individual that has been given the opportunity to write a series of books that reflects the real life drama of what was her life. Pray that someone is healed, helped, set free, delivered and comes back from the hardships of their lives just by reading about the things that happened to me. God Bless.

This guidebook covers requirements for current and future hospital leadership with focus on the Dental Department. By means of briefly chronicling the evolution of hospitals dating back from the eighteenth century to their present corporate structure, it provides a context for understanding the role of the dental department in the hospital. The book is presented in four sections. The first is historical, the second describes the governance, organization and management. The third section covers a broad range of subjects.

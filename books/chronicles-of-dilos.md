The world of Dilos under two moons is now at peace, though evil will soon rise again from history and legend.

Twin brothers Shadon and Madra, rejected in their youth by their peers for being different from the norm, are found to be the recipients of prophecy. In their teen years, a wizard undertakes the task of educating and training them and a childhood friend, Bo, in preparation for what is to come.

It is a battle for the survival of their world against a dark warlord and his evil sorcerer, who reemerge from ages past, commanding an army bent to their will.

Swords and magic are not the only weapons wielded in this conflict, nor mortal life and freedom the only prizes to be won or lost.

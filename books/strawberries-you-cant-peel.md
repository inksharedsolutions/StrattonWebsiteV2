Instead of a fun-filled two-week tour of Europe, the Swinging Seniors find themselves in a Paris prison, accused of the murder of their unpleasant tour guide, Harriet Spears, and their bus driver has disappeared. Fortunately, an alert Swinging Senior solves the crime, and most of the seniors go home happy.

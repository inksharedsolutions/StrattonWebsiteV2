In this world, there are people who walk the earth that carry special gifts. For Abraham Moreno, it comes with a cost. Trusting his extraordinary abilities to find his purpose, he must face his greatest fear.

As he confides in his best friend, Donnie, and the love of his life, Liv, he soon realizes that he may have revealed secrets to the wrong people. His faith is tested when God's gifts bring him love and joy as well as trials and tribulation.

Pushed to the brink of unleashing this anomaly, an unlikely evil arises that will challenge his very existence. Facing an adversary equipped with skills that are equally matched, he endures betrayal, deception, and a fear he has never known before.

Ultimately, he may have to give up his life in order to find out what he was truly meant for.

The book is a collection of poetry written over many years, based on the actual experiences of the author's life.

I was born in a small village of Marvel, Co. I graduated from high school at Farmington, N.M. in 1947. I still live at the home I shared with my late husband, Patrick Cugnini, in Durango, CO.

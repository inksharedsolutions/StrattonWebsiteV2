Grew Tuckett was born with one eye; he was unable to work in the paper mill in the town where he grew up. His dog companion guided him eventually to working with dogs, first in a veterinary hospital, then to his own dog business. He also became a dog-show judge. Tales of the sexual affairs among the dog people and the challenges he faced are the story.

As a young man, Gordon Garrett worked as a cook in logging camps and on tugboats, but because of his association with dogs, went on to work with veterinarians. Eventually, he started his own kennel where he bred, boarded, and groomed dogs. That is where he started writing first about German Shepherds and then all breeds. He went on to judge at dog shows and also became a security supervisor at shopping centers. When he retired, he took university courses, getting a BA at age seventy-six. Then he started to write in earnest. He has published two books previously.

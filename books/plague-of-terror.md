Ravenous entities from hell and messengers of heaven engage in a terrible spiritual battle when Satanists and terrorists join forces to unleash a deadly plague upon the planet. Can a small band of men and women stop the pandemic holocaust? Will three romantic relationships forged during the social chaos withstand an apocalyptic battle with evil? The answers hide with a strange man with brown skin and blue eyes, suddenly present and just as suddenly gone.

On September 8, 2018, I posted my first blog entry on my newly published website, www.awarenessempowerment.com. After a time, a loyal follower of my blog suggested perhaps putting my entries into a book format for the benefit of those unfamiliar with my website.

The contents of what is within these few pages is a collection of inspired topics that I was guided to expand on each month. There are a couple of months that I did two entries for reasons that I didn't question. It is my hope that you may find a little something here that will inspire or enlighten you on your spiritual pathway.

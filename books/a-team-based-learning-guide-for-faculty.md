Team-Based Learning (TBL) engages students in active learning, which promotes both the acquisition and retention of knowledge. This is in sharp contrast to the classic method of teaching by lecturing to students. The didactic lecture creates a passive learning environment in which students memorize facts and then regurgitate them on exams. We refer to this as bulimic learning. Knowledge retention is short-lived when the learning process is passive.

Research has shown that TBL enhances problem solving, improves student performance, sharpens critical thinking skills, prolongs knowledge retention, and ensures a high degree of learning satisfaction. TBL should replace the lecture in every academic program.

This book will provide faculty with a concise set of instructions on how to create a TBL course. Faculty will be guided through the process of developing learning outcomes and objectives, identifying fundamental course concepts, designing guided learning handouts, and assessing student learning.

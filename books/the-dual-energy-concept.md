The current single energy concept has run its course. It cannot explain the simplest of quantum interactions without violating laws of mathematics and physics. The Dual Energy Concept states that dark energy is not atomic in form and that the Absolute Energy Medium is a combination of the two energies coexisting in singularity. By doing so, questions in quantum mechanics, relativity, and the universe can be simply and physically explained without violating any laws.

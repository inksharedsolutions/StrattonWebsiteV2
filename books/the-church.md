The book,Â ***The Church: The Body of Christ-Preaching through Ephesians***, is looking at the church in all of its many dimensions and understanding that as a body of Christ; the church must tear down the barriers of classism, sexism, and racism. Upon reading through the book of Ephesians, the author saw that the body of Christ must be large enough to include all people and the issues that Paul saw in the body of Christ are still alive today. The sermons in this book were preached at the Corinthian Missionary Baptist Church, where the author serves as pastor. I pray that they inspire others as they inspired that congregation.

Bobby Isaiah stands in the midst of a gang war with weapons firing as fellow gang members are falling in bloodshed within inches of him. He stands, holding his chest, to his astonishment of why death has eluded him. Bobby's mother, Kimberly Ingram, a God-fearing woman, has her own ghastly testimony of how her husband, Tone, who seems to love her, falls into infidelity. Her only sister, Sue, lost hope in God due to the death of their mother and father in a tragic plane crash. From the ghetto to the hills and back to the ghetto, Kim has nothing left but hope that all things will work for her good because she belongs to God. Come take this inner-city journey through pages revealing to our society God's unfailing love to all His creation.

Brian and Kutania Ingram are graduates of Luther Rice University. Kutania has her BA in biblical counseling and Brian has his BA in religion and ministry. They've been married for twenty-two years and have two beautiful daughters, Kenya and Zionne. They serve in ministry at Christ Church Presbyterian in Atlanta, Georgia.

The author considers this book as a guide, and not a Do It Yourself Manual. He has attempted to eliminate jargon, and to simplify what can be a very complex, and stressful time of life. You will find a common sense approach to dating again, sex, marriage, and many other problems confronting seniors, male, or female, who find themselves single once more. Hopefully, you will also find some laughs.

Don is now eighty-seven and a graduate of the University of Baltimore and has held numerous management positions over his sixty-five year business career. He retired from his activities as a Consultant in Dec. 2016 so that he might devote more time to his love of writing (He has published two novels), painting, travel, and to spend more time with his second wife. Don is eighty-seven, and lost his first wife to lung cancer in 2009, after fifty-five years of a great marriage.

The song says it all, "Love is Wonderful the Second Time Around," Don and his wife, also a widow, met on the internet, on a dating site for seniors. They have now been together for seven years, and a number of the areas which he discusses in this "Guide," are a direct reflection of this relationship, observations, experiences, and research. This is one of the happiest times of his life, and it is his hope that this guide will help others to find the love, happiness, and contentment that he now enjoys in these later years of his life.

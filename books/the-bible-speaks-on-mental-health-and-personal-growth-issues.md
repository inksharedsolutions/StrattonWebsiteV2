"Why am I so anxious? Why do I feel depressed? Why do I feel like a failure and a reject and sometimes wonder how even God could love me?" The answer to these questions and many more are addressed in this book.

Christians are people too. Many Christians struggle with depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, family conflicts, etc. Christian and secular self-help books abound. The Bible is incredibly rich in resources that address these issues. This book is based on the author's experience in over forty-four years of professional counseling and an intensive study of the Bible as it addresses mental health and emotional issues as well as personal growth concerns. It is addressed to both the individual needs of the reader and as an assist to Christian counselors in helping their patients. The material in this book has been used as handouts to the author's patients with very positive feedback.

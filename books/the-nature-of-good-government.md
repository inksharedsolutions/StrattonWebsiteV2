The government should be a government of people, not money. The Occupy Wall Street movement senses this but lacks focus. This book provides that focus.

The government has roles to play in the safety, conflict resolution, and pooling resources. The roles that the government has to play require strict adherence to the rules. There can be no forgiveness.

Religion asks for perfection. To ask for the impossible guarantees failure. The role religion has to play must have forgiveness for failure to achieve perfection.

This book looks at these roles, part of the essential elements of every manâ€™s life, and finds that the confusion between them is a major part that faces Americans.

H. Doyle Smith has degrees in economics, government, history, and business. This has been augmented with experience in corporate editing, individual taxation, government and military experience, and many other ways that people use to contribute to the society.

The result is a revolutionary point of view that looks at our current difficulties and suggests that our government should attempt to solve problems, rather than bemoan them.

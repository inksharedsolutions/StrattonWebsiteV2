The Exceptional Teenagers’ Development League Book tells its stories and helps to guide both youth and those who work with them to embrace the vital lessons for living wisely that those stories share. By spending time reading these stories, reflecting on their messages, and applying the insights they suggest, teenagers can equip themselves to deal skillfully with present and future concerns in the social, educational, workplace, and citizenship arenas. 

*“The works of Colonel Holland Bynam are among the most approachable tools available in the process of mentoring students and adults to excel emotionally and intellectually. In writing this inspirational, highly readable, insightful, and innovatively structured book, he continues his quest to empower others. Once again, by sharing his uncommon insights—this time with teenagers who wish to set themselves apart from their peers in the success arena—Colonel Bynam has produced a powerful yet wonderfully accessible tool for those who seek excellence in themselves, as well as for those whose role it is to assist in this developmental process.”*

An Aflac sales legend shares a fast-track system that enabled him to become the company's #1 account opener during his rookie year.

Author Jonny Burgess got licensed to sell Aflac in November 2008, thinking a second source of income could supplement his struggling food business.

With just weeks until his wedding, he needed to make a lot of money fast, so he invented a system and went to work. He became the company's best performer in the country, opening seventy-two accounts in eleven months, before being promoted to DSC.

Now, he focuses on teaching others his fast-track system. In this guide-book, he offers advice to help other reps secure an immediate cash-flow with Aflac, create wealth, and secure their financial future, and work hard, but play even harder.

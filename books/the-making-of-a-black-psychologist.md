This book brings to life the struggles that black people, especially in the Deep South, had to endure at the hands of a white society that relegated them to second-class citizenship. Against all odds, many southern blacks were able to rise above hatred and bigotry. This book traces the life of a black clinical psychologist as he makes his northern migration and encounters even a deeper form of racial hatred and bigotry. This book touches the core of one's soul and will change your heart in a way that you've never imagined.

This is the story of a lost little black dog that was rescued by a little girl named Jessica and how she fit in with her new family.

Barbara K. Floyd lives with her husband in a little farming community near Phoenix, Arizona. She is a mother and grandmother who has read many stories to children over the years. She enjoys crocheting, cross-stitching, doing crossword puzzles, as well as writing stories and poems. She was born and raised in California but has lived in many other states following her husband's working career with power plants.

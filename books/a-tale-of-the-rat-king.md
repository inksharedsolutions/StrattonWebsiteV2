This whimsical story takes place at the once beautiful land called the rat kingdom. One day, an evil, wicked, power hungry rat took over the kingdom. The horrible ruler only cared about himself and not the hard working struggling rat people. The Rat King did nothing to stop a deadly plague that fell upon their kingdom. He only wanted more money and more power at any cost. The hard working rats were becoming very ill and even dying. They were losing their jobs, couldn't pay their rent, and were going hungry, all because the Rat King lied to them. He kept saying the plague was fake and would magically go away. He was wrong but he would not admit it. Fortunately, help was close at hand. A very bright, brave and caring elder rat stepped forward to save the kingdom. The elder rat challenged the evil Rat King for the top spot, and won. The evil Rat King was banished to a far, far away land where he can not harm the rat people or the kingdom ever again.

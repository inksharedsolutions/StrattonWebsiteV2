Bring it with an attitude is a novel about three All American girl high school basketball players who decided to attend the same university. They did so because they felt the coach at another university had been disrespectful to the coach of the school they were considering attending. This novel chronicles the girl's background and families and follows them from their humble beginnings into their collegiate careers. Because of their commitment to hard work, unparalleled dedication, and audacious confidence, the girls embark on a season of scintillating play and victories. The girls confront real life issues and learn on the fly how to deal with their new found freedom, their basketball lives which are elevated to an entirely different level, and other personal demands. Their unparalleled drive, dedication, and competitiveness take the reader on a ride through their initial collegiate year where they collectively tear a path of brilliance through the ranks of women's collegiate basketball.

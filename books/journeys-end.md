In Journey's End, we write about death, dying, and end-of-life issues. We attempt to define and describe these real-life circumstances, and we discuss ways to proactively deal with them. Multiple personal and professional perspectives provide valuable insights.

What is dying like for the dying person, for loved ones, and for those who lend support? Each experience will have unique qualities. While we explore the dying process, we make no assumptions about how any particular death will unfold.

In Journey's End Part 1: Heartfelt Stories of Death and Dying, our primary focus is the personal accounts of laypeople and of professionals who support dying persons at the end of life. These stories, while unique in detail, hold universal truths for anyone experiencing the end of life. Our intention is to bring the topics of death and dying into the light, to provide a resource that can instruct and inspire compassion and understanding for anyone who is in the midst of their own or another's end-of-life journey.

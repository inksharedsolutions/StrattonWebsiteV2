Gary Andersen was raised on farms his parents rented near small towns in Minnesota. He graduated from high school, one of eight boys in a class of fifteen, then received a BSEE (days) and BSBA (nights) from the University of Minnesota. Over five decades, he went from designing computer logic and memory systems to sales and marketing positions with several companies including Intel Corporation. He and his family moved to the Bay Area in 1975 and to Texas for an expected two years in 1979, but have remained in Texas. In 1986, he became the sixth CEO of a small, never profitable, seven-year-old high-tech venture-capitalist-backed company. He dramatically grew the company and made it profitable. He managed the company's successful IPO in 1994 and then left on his tenth anniversary as CEO. He and his wife are actively involved with their family and a wide range of friends.

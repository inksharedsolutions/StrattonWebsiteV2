*“In the world you shall have tribulations, but be of good cheer for I have overcome the world.”*

It’s easy to say you love God when all is well in your life. But God never promised us that life in this world would be a bed of roses. The word of God tells us that many are the afflictions of the righteous, but God reassures us that He will deliver us from them all. For the Love of God plays out those principles in the story of a father and son as they struggle to maintain their faithfulness and love for God in the midst of the tragedies, trials, and temptations that everyone who is called of God will encounter in life. This book encourages the reader to stay strong in faith and love for God, knowing that the love He has for you will never fail, and He will show Himself strong on your behalf if you only believe. For the Love of God is a spiritual and emotional roller-coaster ride that underscores one simple fact: Even in the face of adversity, everything we do, in words or in deeds, must be done for our love of God-and in His eternal love for us, we can find peace within ourselves and our lives in Christ.

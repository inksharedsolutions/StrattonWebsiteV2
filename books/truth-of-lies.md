This nation was founded on Christian principles, but for the past generation or so, we, as a people, have slowly but surely been pushing God further and further into the background. We are becoming a godless society. Just as nature abhors a vacuum, as God is removed from society, something else rushes in to fill that void, and rest assured, anything that replaces God will be inferior to that which it replaces. As God and his righteousness are removed, all these forms of unrighteousness rush in to fill the void. Just as a room becomes darker as light is removed, so is our nation becoming an ever-darkening shade of gray.

I really believe the moral decay of the United States can be shown to be the result of eliminating God, usually by judicial means. It is important that everyone realize what is happening because this is the mechanism by which truth is turned into lies, and lies become truth.

The book, The Secret That Lies Beneath, has been written for the individuals who have suffered from a broken heart at the ending of their relationships. The broken bond of a relationship can be compared to the loud "pop" of a light bulb that echoes throughout a room when it illuminates it for the final time.

For over 3,000 years people have been experiencing broken hearts. Many cultures compare the success of a relationship to the Infinity symbol. People believe that when a relationship has ended a break has occurred within the Infinity symbol of that relationship. Infinity represents regeneration which can help to keep a relationship harmonious, balanced and happy.

The Infinity symbol can be compared to the structure of the double helix of the DNA that makes up all the cells of the human body. A break in these cells can result in illness, disease and death. The broken bond of the Infinity symbol of a relationship can help to explain the extreme pain of the heart and soul. On the other hand, a harmonious, healthy relationship emits a positive energy between both partners which is depicted with the Infinity symbol.

The heart does not discriminate when falling in love with another individual. The Secret That Lies Beneath offers insight and remedies to help heal an individual's heart and soul. Far too often individuals put the blame onto themselves upon the ending of a relationship. When meeting an individual, who may be a long-term partner, we need to trust this individual slowly before allowing them full access to our heart and soul. Trust is earned. The book delves into the reasons that we fall in love with certain individuals and helps us identify healthy relationships in the future.

I wish you all long and happy lives while on your path of self-discovery! May you be strong with the sudden twists and turns that life has to offer us. Embrace each lesson and person that we meet along our journey. It helps to bring us to be the person that we are today and to the partner of our future.

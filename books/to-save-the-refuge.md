Between three strange murders, constant poaching in the wild life refuge, and the planned protest against the resort that is destroying the wild life refuge, Mack Thomas has his hands full. That's just the beginning though. He receives a totally unexpected inheritance, which alone, is enough to change his life. Then another unexpected event occurs when someone suddenly becomes a huge part of his life. Someone who shouldn't be part of his life, but is now and forever will be. Then disaster strikes, and it changes everything, even though everything has already been changed.

Michael has had a lifetime interest in the environment and the difficulty protecting it. He is an avid reader of history, science, and fiction, especially mysteries. He is a retired carpenter, but was a computer programer/operator, a 24/7 service station manager, a dairy farmer, grocery clerk, and even picked potatoes with migrant farm workers. He has been married over 50 years and is now retired. He enjoys writing, gardening, studying history and science, and outdoor photography.

With over five decades of service to his country, Hal is certainly not a man to be easily detoured or dissuaded from his mission. This book is a real testament of how long-suffering, perseverance, loyalty, integrity, and patriotism. Hal’s wit and humor which he never outgrew even until today, allowed him to associate with highly recognized and well-established people. His life really began after he was kicked out by his father. He had a bitter childhood that continued well into his teens, but everything changed after he became a member of the United States Marine Corps. His success was not given to him on a silver platter, it was definitely a roller-coaster adventure.  He lived, he laughed, he cried, he loved, he fell, and he rose yet again. From an Outhouse to the White House, and Then Some, will show you just how he did it.

Hal Davis is a distinguished US Marine (Ret.) with a career that spanned twenty-two years. In his heart, service is for a lifetime. He grew up in Morehead, Kentucky, and life back then was never easy. Deprived of all the good things that a childhood normally brings, he remained steadfast in reaching his goals. He became a Tennessee State Trooper, FBI Special Investigator, United States Secret Service Agent to two US presidents, and a Marine and Naval Criminal Investigator. He had a fulfilling forty-two-year career, but more than that, Hal is a loving husband to Susan and a father-hero figure to Allison, who’s now their guardian angel in heaven.

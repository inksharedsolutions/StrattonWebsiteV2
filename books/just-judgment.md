The conviction of this book is to demonstrate how everyday facts of life do point our attention to the meaning of life. These facts of life are all around us, yet many are mostly blinded to them or distracted with their own agendas.

In this book, I will provide evidence of where human beings came from, what makes up our world as we experience it, how we got to this point, and what is to come. Please take a ride on this discovery adventure through history and many languages.

Robert Marr is an enthusiastic teacher and student of the scriptures and all types of history. He grew up in a Southern Baptist church and, at age sixteen, had a fiery born-again encounter with the Messiah Jesus. Since discovering the context of the scriptures, Robert has been researching all that pertains to the Old and New Covenant and the impending prophecies.

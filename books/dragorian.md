From nano-tech to dimension jumping and vampires to time travelers, this book has it all. The human hybrid dragon, forged in the dungeons of a mad scientist whose deal with the military for a super weapon goes awry, learns of a plot to enslave humanity. His quest begins with a desire to help an innocent murder victim, and ends up costing him what is most dear to him.

This character driven adventure has twists, turns, and humor enough to bring it all to life. The parallel universe in which it takes place seems almost as real as our own. It's this author's version of urban fantasy meets sci-fi.

Mister Hill is a middle aged father of two, who was inspired by the amazing stories that were created by multiple people, whose lives were, at the time of their first writings, as unimpressive as his own when he decided to write this book. He came to the realization that if the story is captivating enough, people will naturally gravitate to it, and want more from the author.

The stories included Eragon, Harry Potter, and Twilight. Three authors who wrote incredible works of fantasy, that draw their audiences into their worlds. All three authors were, at the time of beginning their respective masterpieces, normal everyday people. Mr. Hill was a truck driver, driving over the road, often being away from his family for weeks at a time, and reading book after book in the time he spent waiting for his next load. He enjoyed the stories so much, he decided to write one of his own.

A childhood memory of a story about a wizard forcing a warrior to drink many potions while being held captive, turning him into a were-dragon, inspired this modern day adventure.

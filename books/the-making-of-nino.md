This is a great story of a family overcoming obstacles without even realizing them as obstacles. Immigrants have always had the "eye" on the "prize" syndrome and Nino, the father, is no exception. His accomplishments with such steady and singular focus are impressive. They are also indicative of the live many immigrants lived to ensure their children would have a better life than circumstance placed upon them. Immigrants are the true heroes of their future generations and Mary's father Nino is no execption.

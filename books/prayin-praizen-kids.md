Pray'in/Praiz'en Kids is a prayer curriculum than utilizes the armor of God (Ephesians 6:11-18), confessions, scriptures, crafts, and character development stories to teach children about prayer. The multisensory curriculum integrates proven methods of teaching and instruction

Dr. Shelton's prayer curriculum has been used at youth camps and in a home-school program to teach children from different faith persuasions about prayer and character development. Prayer can help children become a person of purpose, character, strength, and confidence. The curriculum stimulates a genuine desire in children to pray, praise, and grow in their relationship with the Lord.

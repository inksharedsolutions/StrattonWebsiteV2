Earl "Dusty" Trimmer relates with both skill and personal experience events surrounding our most forgetable and misunderstood war in America's history. He brings it all home with his down-to-earth style and considerable knowledge. In Unbreakable Hearts, Dusty dives into the Vietnamese history and culture and skillfully brings the reader into understanding our Vietnamese enemy's amazing resolve. He brilliantly explains the evolution of our Vietnamese enemy over hundreds of years of invasions and wars. Always defending their country to remain free became an art. In Chapter 7, Dusty describes the Vietnamese women fighters as "Hellcats." My own experience with the formidable Vietnamese Viet Cong women's skills and expertise closely mirrors Dusty's. Hooch girls could plant booby traps in a GI's hooch with a skill and savvy they were forced to learn during decades of on-the-job training in continuous wars with unwelcomed invaders.

My own Military Police experience after leaving the infantry revealed these incidents vividly. In later chapters, Dusty moves into our own veterans' profound resolve and toughness. North Vietnam's famed General Giap called us "an honorable enemy." One could suggest from this writing that our enemy taught us well. We did things in the Vietnam War the average person would have to go to the movies to believe. After reading Trimmer's descriptions, I must conclude that indeed this book could be one for the movie industry.

Dusty Trimmer brings to life our days and nights living and fighting in these foreboding jungle warfare conditions. After reading this fine work and reflecting on my own experiences, I cut away a little more of the pain. Pride swells for having served with all of these wonderful veterans of the Vietnam War. Pain for our terrible losses. For myself, these experiences culminated in wisdom I would otherwise have failed to achieve. God bless Dusty for telling our story. Forward march, Brothers!

A professor at the university who is also a fisherman is having a bad midlife crisis at age fifty-one and is dating one of his students. She is age twenty-two, and her Hawaiian mother disagrees with the arrangement. And Rachel will not introduce her boyfriend, whom she's gotten to know at the university. But Professor Bartholomew Alliance Jackson has fallen in love with Rachel and wants her to marry him. Rachel knows what their relationship will come to, and the finish is most ironic.

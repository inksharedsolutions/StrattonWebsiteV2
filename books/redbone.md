REDBONE: The Misunderstood Light-Skinned Female is a book that explains the plight as well as the perceived privileges that accompany light-skinned females here in the United States. Because their skin color invokes many thoughts and emotions, they are both hated and adored at the same time.

Fairly or unfairly, light-skinned females are associated with being gold diggers, materialistic, arrogant, and conceited. It explains where this "pedestal" reputation of light-skinned females originated as well as the role that the media has played in the perpetuation of this colorism dynamic.

Redbone delves into this current trend of Black male celebrities choosing White, non-Black, and light-skinned females for marriage and dating while leaving the dark-skinned females behind and the impact that it has on the next generation. It also expounds on the hate that fair-skinned girls receive from dark-skinned girls and the motivation behind it. It discusses how in general Blacks really hate themselves and subconsciously want to be as close to White as possible, which has elevated the redbone to rock star status within the Black community.

Redbone takes a critical look at the current beauty standard in Black America. Multiple surveys and interviews that were conducted paints an accurate portrayal of dating preferences in the twenty-first century.

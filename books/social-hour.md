After the death of her husband, Maggie bought a bed and breakfast as a way to provide and income for herself while still being a stay-at-home mom for her two young children. She provides free lodging to anyone who had a wounded soldier in the local hospital, but after three years with many free guests and few paying ones, Maggie is on the verge of shutting her doors.

Hoping she can keep her bed and breakfast open through Christmas, Maggie takes in one final guest, whose sister is in the hospital. But Bryan Connolly isn't the usual guest; he sees her struggling to run the B&B all alone. Impressed by her generous nature, kind heart, and the best cookies he's ever tasted, Bryan is determined to help Maggie.

Through the B&B's nightly social hour of tea and cookies, Maggie and Bryan learn to push beyond past hurts and find love again.

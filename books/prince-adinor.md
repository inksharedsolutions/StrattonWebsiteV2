A coming-of-age fantasy story follows Prince Adinor and his brave company of warriors as they scour the forbidden Petruchani Forest in search of the black-clothed men terrorizing the village of Pionard.

What begins as a simple mission turns into a complex quest that will expose the prince to hardships and new experiences beyond his imaginings. Discovering a race of people known as Nymphs and battling giant bat-like creatures known as Harvingers pale in comparison to the difficulties of teenage questioning Adinor will undergo.

The prince will be exposed to a variety of philosophies along the way, each impacting his self-image. In the end, Adinor must face the ultimate challenge and confront the sorcerer responsible for breeding the demonic monsters and in so doing reveal more accurately than ever who he's meant to become. Answering what type of leader he will be, who is the source of evil threatening Mastada, and what is the nature of his amulet's power will be essential to the prince's growth.

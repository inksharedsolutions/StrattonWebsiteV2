This is a story about a little boy who learns that everything that is fun cannot always be found in a toy box, or even in a book. A story about a little red house with no windows, no doors, and a star inside.

Jimmy starts out on an adventure that takes him many places, meets many people, and learns to trust in others as well as himself. This is a wonderful story about the love and trust a mother has for her son. Also, a story about always believing in yourself and anything is possible.

Why did the Lord see fit to include the book of Ecclesiastes in His inspired Word? Down through the centuries, many people have wondered how Solomon could have moved so far from his walk with the Lord and the wisdom of the Proverbs to the pessimism of Ecclesiastes in one lifetime. For this reason, some have questioned Solomon's authorship of the book. But Solomon is only one of many who have taken a spiritual detour in life. As a result, there are many people in our nation and our world who can readily identify with the outlook of Ecclesiastes, because they too are living their lives as Solomon did for a time-"under the sun." This verse-by-verse tour of Solomon's experience will help you understand where Solomon's spiritual detour took him, and where he finally came to realize he should have been going instead. You will be encouraged to move from "under the sun" to the abundance of life in the light of the Son!

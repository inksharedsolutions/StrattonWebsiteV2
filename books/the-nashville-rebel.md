Another presidential election is pending, another farce in the two-party system! Follow the exploits of the teen idol, the Mafia, the FBI, innocent people drawn into the plot, and the corrupt politicians in this riveting story of brutality, survival, passionate sex, love affairs, revenge, and finally, justice.

What is the outcome?

Deke Rivers, a retired architect and artist, has lived throughout the world, and now calls Toronto, Canada, his home. Most of his novels are based on research, his travels, and his vivid imagination. As an Estonian refugee from World War II, Deke Rivers has circumnavigated the world, worked and lived in a variety of counties, experienced the variety of cultures, and struggled with the languages and a variety of environments--from the heat of the tropics to the icy terrain of the Arctic.

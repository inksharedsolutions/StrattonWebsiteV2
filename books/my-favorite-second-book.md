This is a sequel of My Favorite First Book. It is a collection of poems and stories that are based on real-life events that the author encountered while growing up. Remember that old adage that says, "If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there, does it still make a sound?" It mimics how the contributions of a struggling artist go unheard of until they surface long after his demise. Thanks to a conscientiously persistent publisher, eighty years of wisdom-motivated writings now have a chance to be in the hands of receptive readers. Inspired by the author's mother, who really loves reading books, these heartwarming stories about nature, life in the countryside, and animals will definitely give you nostalgic feeling.

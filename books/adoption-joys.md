Adoption Joys: They Expected a Miracle gives God's plan for unplanned pregnancies as it shares encouraging true stories of the joys adoptive couples have found in adoption. Young, unmarried, single women who have found themselves in an unplanned pregnancy are also encouraged with the truth that these couples love them unconditionally over all the years to come. The baby is welcomed, of course, but not more so than the birth mom. The adoptive couples enter the adoption in a covenanted relationship, just as God expects from the couple in their marriage. Because of the covenant, the birth mom finds their couple and loves them as well as her baby.

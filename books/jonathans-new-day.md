The scene is Isreal in the time of Christ; the hero, a young boy whose life intersects with the Jewish carpenter. This is a classic adventure tale of daring rescues, run-ins with Roman soldiers, revenge by night, and unlooked-for miracles. Life will never be same for one boy, his family, his city, and, ultimately, the whole world. In the spirit of the Newberry-winner, The Bronze Bow, this coming of age trilogy that breathes new life into the greatest story ever told.

As a young professor of New Testament, Ken Easley began telling snippets of these stories aloud at bedtime for his eight year old son. Many years later (and shortly before his death) he put them to paper, crafting the sweeping tale of Jonathan Bar Matthias.

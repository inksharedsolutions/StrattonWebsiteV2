A story about Don Cooper from infancy, born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, his maternal ancestors emigrated from Germany in the 1850s. They made their homesteads in Washington County, Wisconsin. Don visited their farms frequently as a youth and eventually was employed as a farm hand on the farm of his mom's cousin. Those many visits convinced him that he would become a farmer someday. His mom's cousin, Armand "Wimpy" Mertz, became his mentor.

Don worked full-time for him after graduating from high school. He loved the cows, calves, pigs, chickens, wildlife, and especially the horses. Wimpy knew the names of the trees, weeds, other plants, bugs, and all of God's creation. Don admired his vast knowledge and was thankful for having such a wonderful teacher. He soon realized that his chances of purchasing a farm of their own was pretty slim. He worked on several agricultural-related jobs.

His friends Paul and Elvira Brunnquell convinced him to go on a blind date. Ruth Nienow, was his date; he fell madly in love with her and prayed that God would convince her to be his beautiful bride. One year later they were married. Her dad was a farmer, and they decided to purchase a farm. They saw an ad in the paper, "Farm for Rent," and another ad, "Purebred Herd of Holstein Cows for Sale." They purchased the cows and rented the farm. It was a nightmare. There was too much work and not enough income. Their landlord died six months later. The next farm was also bad news. The third rented farm was an excellent farm that provided them with the income needed to purchase their own farm. Dairy Farming: A Way of Life describes the many trials and tribulations they endured. The Lord was with them every step of the way. Without His ever presence and guidance, they would not have not have been able to continue farming.

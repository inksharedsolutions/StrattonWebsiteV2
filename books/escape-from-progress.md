Domed cities have sprung up across the US and have even begun to be built in other countries, advertising a utopian lifestyle-no sickness, no unemployment, and perfect weather all year-but the population is divided on living in this perfect futuristic world and have insisted on living outside the enormous cities. Which lifestyle will dominate? There are hidden reasons for the domed cities' success, and an eighteen-year-old protégé is about to find out what they are and why they are hidden, but there will be trouble ahead, serious trouble.

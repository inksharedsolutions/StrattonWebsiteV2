Rachel's story is a true one of young love, joys, and triumphs experienced, but also is about difficulties of being and staying together as they are beset by hardships, disappointments, and struggles toward making a good life for themselves.

Her story begins in her early teens while growing up in Southern Kentucky and being the oldest child in a large family of very strict parents. She relates of the rigors involved during post-Great Depression years, through WWII, and in her high school years. As a senior in high school with a diploma, a certainty along with a lucrative scholarship promised, she begins to see that her dreams of becoming a teacher can really happen.

As reality hits, she wonders if she really wants this. It means moving away from Denton, her lifelong home, and leaving all the people involved in her life. She has recently met a special person, a returning WWII navy veteran, Brad, who has retuned home to find his life in an uproar. His children were gone, and his wife has deserted him. As he is attempting to pick up the pieces, he meets Rachel.

Rachel and Brad's story is one of joys, beset by poverty, disappointments, and struggles. Through it all, they keep their eyes focused on the light at the end of the tunnel that promises a life of joy and excitement. Interwoven, their hard work, their love for each other, and their trust in God is the common thread that binds it all together.

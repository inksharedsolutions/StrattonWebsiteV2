In the Episcopal Order of Worship, the priest sometimes introduces and mentions the Mosaic Law. The words given to Moses that the word \[bold] is worth thinking about. We do well not to take the law lightly. It will take guts to look and not get bold enough in another way as having personal integrity to be accountable of yourself and be free of all guilt. This book will help you to be set free and true. There is a song that came out in the '60s and a movie, Born Free, the first line of the song caught my attention: "Born free, as free as the wind blows, as free as the grass grows. Born free to follow your heart." This was an inspiration to me. You can be set free and true as your heart.

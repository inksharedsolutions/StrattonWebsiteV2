A Word In Due Season is a collection of poetry designed to capture the heart of God while the reader experiences healing, salvation, and deliverance. Kennesha uses the Word of God through lyrical stanzas, phrases, free verse, and spoken word to help uplift and communicate a profound biblical and practical message to God's people. This message is for those who have an ear to hear what the Lord is saying in this hour. God speaks not only in sermons and novels but in the untapped revelation of poetry and psalms in a modernized style. Every season brings a change spiritually, mentally, emotionally, and physically. The key is being prepared. Are you ready for your due season?

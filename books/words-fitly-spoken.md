Words Fitly Spoken are "like apples of gold in settings of silver," according to Proverbs 25:11. The poetic words of Bruce Goodpaster display those burnished apples in a variety of silver settings. Some reflect dreams or visions, some come from the refinement of trials and sickness, others from meditation on God's faithful promises. All draw the reader away from daily struggles with worry and uncertainty and toward the encouragement found in God's promise that He is returning soon to rule and reign.

Miguel lives in the village of the Rainbow Tree. The Rainbow Tree is a special tree, very big, and very old. The branches of the Rainbow Tree are very large and very high. None of the villagers can see the top of the Rainbow Tree. None of the villagers know that there is a secret hidden in the branches of the tree.

Miguel is in the second grade and likes to visit the old woman who lives in the village. The old woman has lived in the village for more than a hundred years. The old woman is very wise and sometimes helps Miguel with his homework. The old woman asks Miguel whether he can keep a secret. Miguel makes a promise to keep the secret. The old woman tells Miguel a secret about the Rainbow Tree. Miguel promises that he will not tell anyone about the secret. Olivia, Miguel's best friend, wants to know the secret. Miguel knows that he should not tell anyone the secret. Miguel finds that it is very hard to keep a secret.

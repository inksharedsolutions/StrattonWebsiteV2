8 REASONS WHY LOVE IS THE GREATEST SHALL BECOME A WORLD CLASS BEST SELLER

\#1 Because God is love.

\#2 Because of the first and second commandments, of the Lord Jesus Christ.

\#3 Because the title of the book...LOVE IS THE GREATEST.

\#4 Because love has a universal appeal.

\#5 Because love fills the number one need of the human heart.

\#6 Because of love's popular song by Jackie DeShannon entitled "What the World Needs Now is Love, Sweet Love."

\#7 Because God's special blessing has already been upon LOVE IS THE GREATEST, even before it is printed. (For instance the book has been sold in 12 carefully selected target markets of Boston, MA; Quincy, MA; Cape Cod, MA; Philadelphia, PA; Westchester, PA; Wilmington, DE; Chicago, Illinois; Nashville, TN; Dallas, TX; Los Angeles, CA and London, England!!!)

\#8 Because the author himself has an outstanding sales record of being the #1 book salesman out of 5,000 nationwide for three consecutive years at the Southwestern Publishing Company of Nashville, TN, "The publishing capital of the world."

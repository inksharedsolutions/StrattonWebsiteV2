I Am the Way is an art book based on paintings that I have produced over the years as a meditative exercise, what C. G. Jung calls Active Imagination. The images are symbolic, and their meanings are not evident, unless, perhaps, if one has a background in the nature and meaning of universal symbols. In the book, I amplify the meaning of each of the images, which helps the reader understand and relate them. Amplification is a way of working around the image by referring to the universal meaning of similar historical images.

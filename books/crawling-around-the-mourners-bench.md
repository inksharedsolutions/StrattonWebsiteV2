*CRAWLING AROUND THE MOURNERS BENCH*\
 is a compilation of poetic creations entailing the different stage ad of one Darryl Goodner.

There was a time when he was at his lowest, as detailed by the poem “Suicide”. He has endeavored to take his readers on a journey with him, through all his ups and downs...all the way to where he welcomes freedom.

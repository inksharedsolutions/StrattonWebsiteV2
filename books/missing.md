Peter Pickering, a British businessman working for the CIA, disappeared in Switzerland. His wife, Monique, asked detective Tom Powers to find him. Pickering, a distributor of components for durable goods, was recruited to stop the drain of United States' technology for use in weapons by terrorists. Peter's wife, Monique, hired Tom to find Peter, who failed to meet her in Amsterdam after a Zurich business trip.

Ultimately, Peter turned up with amnesia as a John Doe left for dead in Germany. Pickering's journal, which may have contained clues about who attacked him and why, was missing. Tom was shot by an intruder at the client's home in the Berkshires protecting CIA agent Joan Walters.

The investigators traveled to Europe for answers but encountered spies who killed one of Peter's Zurich customers and ransacked his office. Tom's life was saved by the young agent who took down one of the spies and captured the other who were seeking American technology secrets.

Tom and Joan then became more than partners working in Switzerland to stop the flow of arms to terrorists and rogue nations.

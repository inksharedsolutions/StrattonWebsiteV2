A prominent clinical psychologist, Adam Peterson, spends his daily life listening to the woes of his therapy patients.â€¯As tedious as he finds this, he tolerates it in order to pursue his passion of accessing inherited information from past generations through the collective unconscious.

Intrigue enters his life when, through a chance meeting, he discovers and falls in love with a teacher who is an expert in the history of Napoleon, and he arranges with her to write a psychobiography of Napoleon. Through this relationship, he discovers an ancient artifact that was unearthed during Napoleon's Egyptian campaign.

This artifact has long been sought after by unscrupulous CIA agents. The story goes on to weave a web of adventure and mystery, bringing together the lives of people from different worlds and different times.

Integrated is some scientific investigation into DNA and retrieved ancestral experiences, which has been the research of the author, Dr. Ronald Raymond.

Who would have ever thought Wendy would have two guys competing for her attention at once? What was she supposed to do? Sometimes being hit with snowballs by boys and having them pull your hair was a lot easier. Being grown-up was challenging-with so many choices! Should she choose Brent or Russell? See who Wendy chooses in book 3 of the Wendy series!

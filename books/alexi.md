Alexi meets Carl in the Czech Republic to investigate rumors of vampire activity in the Carpathian Mountains. Carl hires Lexi as an interpreter although Lexi is a homophobe. They fall in love with the valley, the people, and each other. They get rid of the vampires but discover the vampires were in cahoots with the mafia, allowing them to ply their evil slave trade. The overarching problem in the valley is that the people are still living in the fourteenth century with barter as the currency of the valley.

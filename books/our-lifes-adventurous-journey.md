Baby boomers come together in this biographical story, a couple's journey through life together. From birth to currently over forty-five years of marriage, good times and bad times, they have persevered as the climb has been steep. Thoughts of giving up came, but with God's help, they have made it through. Their wedding vows were for better and for worse, in sickness and in health, not forsaking each other. Their life story, Christians and husband and wife travelling this journey together, their story and sharing as they present Our Life's Adventurous Journey.

I was afraid to open them to look, just in case I had mistaken him for someone else. And, I didn't want to utter a word about anything-just in case it came out wrong. The only thing I wanted to do was hanging on tight to him and to never, never let him go.

The deep, dark and hypnotic scent of his chemistry moved slowly through my nostrils and gently followed all my senses until it finally worked its way to the back of my throat-and it tasted very much like love.

Having nothing to bring to the girl talk, she did her best to listen quietly take careful note. Sterlings idea of a wild night of sex was doing it on the sofa. "I would love just one night with a man that made me feel the way they do." She sighed.

Frustrate with bedroom boredom, confiding in her lifelong friend, who after bragged on how she dated a man just to get to his wife, advised her to find a man, that it would bring a little spice in her marriage. "Betraying Sterling isn't what I want, I have needs he refuses to meet." she thought.

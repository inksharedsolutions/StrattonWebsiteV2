In the beginning of time, all the free people roamed the fields, plains, and forests of the new world and grew in numbers until the lands become overcrowded. The animals became hungry. Father Time saw the problem and, one moonlit night, brought from the Great Mother Wolf from the waters of the first spring. He then charged her to take from the free peoples the old, sick, and injured so that the strongest and fittest would share the gifts of the new world. Soon the Mother Wolf became overwhelmed with the task that Father Time had given her. She went to Father Time and begged for some helpers. That night she was given four new cubs that looked just like her. The animals were very unhappy and went to Mother Nature to complain that they could not rest because of all the new wolves.

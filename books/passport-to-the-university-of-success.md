Passport to the University of Success is an invitational book for all audiences, mainly in Cameroon. For so long, youth has waited on politicians and academic leaders to solve their problems. Disappointments have been their answer so far. The author believes that the true solution is in our youth potential. In the midst of the socio-political and economic crisis, many people have decided to leave the country in the hope of finding greener pastures somewhere else. Vivien Key believes that Cameroon is the place to be, and people should become the solution of their problems. Citing several other Cameroonians who are making it, the author wants to awaken the ingeniousity of his young fellow countrymen, and prove that it does not matter where you are or where you are coming from. Success is available to each of us. The stories of those who have succeeded should be the catalyst and motivation of our own desire to win.

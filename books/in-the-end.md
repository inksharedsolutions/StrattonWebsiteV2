A Sinkhole Swallows 12 Teens\

In this young/adult adventure novel, 12 senior high boys attempt to escape death by sliding down a rope and climbing into an old mine tunnel, the entrance to an underground labyrinth.\

One of the boys senses a menacing presence, but he can't prove its existence. Then the mine's dangers claim one life after another.\
\
The close-knit boys soon realize that their limited food and water supplies is the least of their problems. Hope of returning home changes to needing to find a way out of the endless, dangerous, dark tunnels to escape whatever is killing them off.\

Company K, in the infantry regiment of the Holcombe Legion, was formed mostly by men from Upstate South Carolina. They were patriotic sons of their state and enlisted long before the draft by the Confederate Government. All the "boys" of Company K had strong independent streaks and thus, were well-suited for service in the unattached brigade commanded by Gen. Nathan Evans. Evans's Brigade was sent to hot spots from Virginia to Mississippi. They saw action from Charleston to Petersburg with Malvern Hill, Second Manassas, Kinston, Jackson, and Rappahannock Station.

Their exploits are narrated by Parson Jud, who was captured twice. After the first, he was paroled. After the second, Jud was imprisoned but soon escaped and walked from Elmira, New York, to Harpers Ferry, aided along the way by pacifists, Copperheads, Dunkards, and Pennsylvania Dutch.

Line on line and word on word the story unfolds to the rhythm of the hip hop and poetic styles of feelings driven with passion to tell the story of the escape of a child crying somewhere in the dark from rape and defeat but the family remains unattentive. The despairing hope is no where to be found but the moments of bloodshed and self-preservation opens in distress what time only could reveal of the agony of silently suffering with no love and tender care.

Once again, Ralph Mullen faces danger, but this time, he's on a mission for his grandson, who seems to have inherited his grandfather's nose for adventure, intrigue, and murder.

This is Perry's fifth Ralph Mullen book. Perry lives in Spring, Tx. and continues to follow his passion in Astrophysics (will there be a new book of travel in the universe?). His prolific writing has given his readers eight books and he intends to keep them busy for years to come.

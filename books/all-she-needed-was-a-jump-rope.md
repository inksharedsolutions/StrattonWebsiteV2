The book describes a sample of school incidents and teacher-training situations to help readers understand the behavioral problems schools deal with on a daily basis. It also shows how, in working together, it is possible to convert many classroom misbehaviors into positive learning experiences for students, teachers, and school principals, as well faculty members in the teacher education field. The key is to ensure that all participants-teachers, students and parents, are treated with respect and whatever behavioral situations that arise are treated as learning experiences.

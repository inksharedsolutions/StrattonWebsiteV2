Teaming up with an LAPD homicide detective, the trio soon learn not only are the prime suspects prior adversaries, but an unsuspecting ally is supplying the suspects with Box and Carl's every move. In the end, the trio solved the puzzle, but the pieces fell together in a way none of them would have ever imagined.

This challenging book called cruisin' above the clouds portrays an exceptional God, and an exceptional place in my heart, equal to finding Utopia. However, finding the place called Utopia has duel meaning, and being euphoric in mind and spirit are similar to finding the land of Utopia.

Beyond the shadow of the doubt, the peaceful and beautiful land of Utopia is somewhere in the heavens above. And it has streets of gold and gates of pearl. And I am one-hundred percent for certain, it's the select place to live in this universe.

Within this all about heaven book, cruisin' above the clouds means, I've found an intangible euphoric frame of mind. And my wonderful feelings for the land of Utopia are expressed through the many unusual and sincere bible stories I write.

I am certain, most people believe the land of Utopia is an imaginary place, not real and tangible, and it would be impossible to find. However, finding the land of Utopia, and the euphoric spirit of Utopia isn't impossible to find. And one cannot be found, unless we find the other.

I do want you to know, even though it's not a secret location. The map leading us to the land of Utopia doesn't have an "x" marking the location. However, it's for certain, we do have to grow wings and cruise above the clouds to find it.

Finding the land of Utopia requires a Spirit Guide, and when we become euphoric about the world of God. Our caring Spirit Guide reveals a place above the clouds, and it's where the euphoric treasure hunters find their perfect home.

This serious and meaningful book has fifty-five unique bible stories. And reading them is like taking a cruise above the clouds, and entering into the realms of Utopia. And finding the land of Utopia will be like finding the Garden of Eden, and I do hope you find the kingdom of God too.

God bless you.

Cristin was swimming and looked up and saw the dragons flying her way. She got out and got into her tent then came out a few minutes later as the dragons were landing. She saw them transforming into their human forms. As she finds out that her father is dying, she goes with them. She goes with them to her handmaiden's eleven hatch party. Her brother is trying to kill her, and he starts a war between his sister and him instead of looking for the golden dragon egg.

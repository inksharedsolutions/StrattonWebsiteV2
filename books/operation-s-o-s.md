The Super Sib Squad is back, and this time they are headed for the North Pole! After discovering superpowers and saving the world last week, David, Kate, and Collin are adjusting to life as heroes. But living a normal life might be harder than they expect, and being trapped in the body of a Chihuahua might be David's mildest adventure.

Oliver Sawyer is back in action, and his latest scheme could not only threaten the success of Ice Maker, but the very lives of the Squad. Lured to the North Pole under the ruse of a presidential request, Kate, Collin, and David must leap into action to thwart the nefarious Oliver and rescue Ice Maker from destruction.

It's an emergency of arctic proportions in the second installment of the Super Sib Squad. Can the kids come through and stop Oliver from completing his dastardly plot? Read on and discover thrills and chills in Operation: SOS.

Jape Malarkey is a married mother of three superheroes: Colin, David Junior, and Kate. She wrote the Super Sib Squad series at the behest of her children, to whom she can rarely say no. The Super Sib Squad books were created and then highly debated over endless dinner discussions and car trips and are the culmination of an entire family's inspirations and ideas, including dad to the Sib Squad, David. Operation: SOS is the exciting sequel to the Super Sib Squad's first adventure, Operation: Ice Maker.

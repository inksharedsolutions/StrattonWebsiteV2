Pharmacology for Health Care Providers provides a vital discussion of the pharmacology, physiological effects, use, and proper administration of commonly prescribed drugs. It is very useful for both quick studies and on-the-job reference. The book features an in-depth pedagogical section which details the mechanism of action, effects, and adverse effects of the major drug classes, presented by system. The discussion includes the various therapeutic effects, of widely prescribed drug classes, and approved uses, as well as drug and food contraindications and adverse effects that may be expected.

This book is a "must-have" for health care providers. For the pharmacy technician, the information presented can allow accurate verification of the information presented on a prescription and determine if the drug and dosage prescribed for the patient are appropriate. Nurses and medical personnel will find the information useful in checking for drug-drug interactions and assessing patient symptoms which may be drug or dosage related. The book is, in general, a useful educational reference, and a handy guide for screening patient medications before and during administration.

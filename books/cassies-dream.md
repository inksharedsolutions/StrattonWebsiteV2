Fighting against the images, she could not see their faces, nor could she determine the time, the place, or what was responsible for the event. "Who are those people?" she thought.

Cassie's Dream

At Fiddler's Green, where seamen true when here they've done their duty. The bowl of grog shall still renew

And pledge to love and beauty.

Cassie had a troubled look on her young freckled face. Standing on the sandy beach, her toes wiggling in the ebb and flow of the tide, she gazed over the water that sparkled gold in the evening light. Her hair reflected the rays of the setting sun as the cold waves washed over her bare feet, sending a chill through her lightly clad body. Overhead were three seagulls, making coaxing noises as they watched intently waiting for the morsel of bread she usually held out to them in her small, gentle hand. She loved the gulls. At times it seemed they were her only friends. She was a lonely child. Other children thought her strange. Cassie was like her namesake Cassandra, the beautiful oracle in Greek mythology, who also saw things that others could or would not see. Most folks felt uncomfortable with the telling of her visions and left her by herself to ponder what was to come. But today, there was no treat for the birds. She had run quickly from the cottage, thinking only of her dream from the night before. Even her mother scolded her for fantasizing.

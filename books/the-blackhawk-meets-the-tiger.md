The BlackHawk begins to terrorize a small city, pirates led by Skull terrorize the Dormoth waters of their merchant trade, Emperor Caja taxes his people to near starvation, and King Docera of the dwarves find his people in harm's way as giants attack.

Then appears a man dressed in white robes. He quickly makes a name for himself as he brings change to his part of this world. No one knew who he was or where he came from. These are his stories, his adventures. He was Tigerious Kunig. Most knew him as "the Tiger." Could a ninja one day become a great king?

Come, take a walk with the bard of Serious.

Any activities that involve associations between people require that there be an acceptable level of trust. The ability to make accurate assessments about the reliability of others will determine, over time, how trustworthy they are. While it takes a long time to build trust, it takes even longer if trust is lost.

This book is designed to aid in building and maintaining healthy relationships. In doing this, we investigate several ways that trust is betrayed.

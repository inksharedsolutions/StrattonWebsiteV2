Usurper was inspired from a true story of a young man named Antonio Ferretti in 1890s in Trenton, New Jersey, who used a priest name of Father Mariano Luca as his own in getting a job as an Italian priest in Denver, Colorado. The young man with no experience struggled but he endured and won over the towns people, including the local Bishop. He worked hard, getting a new church, built, but with controversy. Having a lonely life he secretly had a child. The railroad worked its way past their town bringing wealth, misery, happiness and unexpected tragedy. Father Luca excepted his challenge and secretly learned to be a priest never reveling his true identity. Performing funerals at the far away cemetery proved to be a challenge. Sometime later Father Luca's secret catches up with him and tragedy happens. The city remembers him by naming their new church after him.

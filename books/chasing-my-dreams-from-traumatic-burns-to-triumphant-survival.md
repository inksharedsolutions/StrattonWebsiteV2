Barbara Kammerer's dream job was being a teacher, impacting the lives of junior high kids so they could soar in life. Her dream became jeopardized after a fiery car crash left her with a severe burn injury. She found herself facing the public's reactions to her facial and body difference with constant stares and startled glances, intrusive questions and rude remarks. Her trauma began a life-long mission to develop skills to empower burn survivors and anyone with a facial difference to live successfully. In an age when the disabled and facially disfigured were shunned by societal norms, her advocacy paved the way for kids and adults to find their path back to life. Chasing My Dreams is the inspirational memoir of a gracious and beloved woman who quietly, but purposefully fought for those who needed to find their own voice.

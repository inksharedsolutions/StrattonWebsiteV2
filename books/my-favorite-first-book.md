Each new page starts a new subject with an entirely different animal and a mostly true story line. I have also included many colorful illustrations that give the reader a preconditioned (subliminal) idea of the story line, thus helping the reader to grasp and assimilate within their attention span and hopefully retain the information they are being exposed to.

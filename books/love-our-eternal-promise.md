Val and Daniel's grandson has decided to join the army to follow in his father's and grandfather's footsteps. His unit is deployed to Afghanistan.

Daniel and his team are on a covert mission for the government in the same area. Val and the COC team work together to assist in a mission the military can't get involved in, a rescue and recovery mission on the Pakistani side of the border.

It is left up to Daniel and his people to handle the mission to rescue hostages as a nonmilitary mission as Val and those on the home front prepare for the upcoming annual Christmas gala.

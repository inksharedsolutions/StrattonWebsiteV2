This collection of short stories introduces the mysterious and handsome Sebastian Cricket and his loyal lover and life partner, Justin. The unlikely pair seem to attract trouble and often find themselves in the most dangerous predicaments one might conjure. Sebastian is a man of action and few words, and his expeditions are told by Justin, a man of tender feelings, a sensitive and loyal reporter, and always on Sebastian's side.

Sebastian Cricket's mission is simple: use the skills he learned as an elite special operations soldier to help those in distress, by any means necessary.

From the "Snow Viper"

The massive belching engine, an iron relic forged in a distant century, struggled to pull us up the steep mountainside. With each gasp and lurch, my stomach tied itself into knots, my heart pounded, and my clenched hands dripped with hot sticky sweat. The beast would have been more appropriate in a museum than perched on narrow-gauge tracks, but here we were, nevertheless. It was terrifying knowing we had scant purchase on the steep incline and could plummet to our deaths at any moment. The deafening grind of the train's wheels as it rounded sharp mountainous curves, inching higher and higher through dense forest and across rocky cliffs, was such a terror I had rarely endured.

Little did I realize even greater perils lay ahead.

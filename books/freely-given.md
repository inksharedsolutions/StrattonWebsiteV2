Freely Given is the first companion book to Whispers from the Father, which the author published in 2013. The author highlights a series of real-life situations and adds insight to those situations by relating them to scripture. As you read each story, you will be transported to the scene as the author describes it in vivid detail. His ability to couple each story with a scripture reference assists the reader in applying God's word on the subject.

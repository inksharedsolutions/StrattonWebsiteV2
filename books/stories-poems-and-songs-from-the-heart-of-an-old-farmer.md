"Dedicated to glory of Jesus Christ and God's True Word, the Holy Bible" is Don's mission statement, and throughout all of his writings, he tells how the Lord has been at his side throughout his whole life. Without His presence, Don could have never done the seemingly impossible things he's done.

This book is a compilation of stories, poems, and song lyrics, which really do come from the heart of a former dairy farmer who sincerely desires to share his love for Jesus and God's true Word, the Holy Bible, with you. It tells of our faith and experiences during our time as dairy farmers and how those two intertwined.

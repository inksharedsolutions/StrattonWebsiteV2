"In the spirit of her previous memoirs, Mary reveals her profound fortitude, perseverance, faith and inspiring optimism amidst her constant trials, including her own injuries and health problems. This is a must read for everyone, especially for baby boomers who may soon be facing their own needs for nursing and rehabilitation care."

\-Jack Murray, retired Editor of The Regional News, Freelance Writer

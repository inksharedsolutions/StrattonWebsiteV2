Doris Howe is a missionary with Youth with A Mission. Her mission field is in Tyler, Texas at Loving Alternative Adoption Agency. She has been an adoption caseworker for over 24 years. Her main task is to minister to young women who find themselves in an unplanned pregnancy. She is to love them, educate them, and pray with them. God's ultimate call for Doris is to introduce these young women to Jesus Christ who is there to help change their lives. An adoption may or may not be part of that relationship. Doris has two books published. One is called Adoption Joys they expected a miracle. The other is a family book called The Shaws Multiplied.
